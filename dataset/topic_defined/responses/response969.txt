In the supermarket, a place of wonder
Aisles of abundance, thunder
Fresh produce, meats, and bread galore
A feast for the senses, and more in store

The checkout lines, they slowly move
As you wait, your patience does prove
But when it's done, oh what a treat
Your groceries, homeward bound at your feet.
