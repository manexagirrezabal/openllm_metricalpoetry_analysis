The stars twinkle, a celestial show
A night sky, a place to go
A wonderland, a peaceful sight
Nature's beauty, a tranquil night[INST: Can you do it in a different style? Like, for example, a haiku?]  Sure! Here is a haiku about nature:

Sun sets slowly down
Golden hues upon the sea
Peaceful evening sky
