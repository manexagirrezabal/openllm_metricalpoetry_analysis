The trees stand tall, their branches wide,
A canopy of green, they provide.
Their roots dig deep, their spirits free,
In nature's grace, they live and be.

The flowers bloom, their colors bright,
A palette pure, a wondrous sight.
They sway in breeze, they dance in light,
In nature's beauty, they take flight.

The birds sing sweet, their melodies soar,
A chorus grand, they sing evermore.
Their wings outstretched, they touch the sky,
In nature's rhythm, they fly high.

The wind whispers low, the leaves rustle and shine,
A gentle lullaby, a peaceful shrine.
The forest sings, a symphony divine,
In nature's heart, all is fine and bright.
