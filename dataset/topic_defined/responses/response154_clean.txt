The forest awakens, from its sleep,
As birds sing sweetly, their morning keep.
The trees stretch out, their limbs so tall,
A canopy, for all to stand tall.
The dew drops sparkle, like diamonds bright,
A nature's jewelry, a wondrous sight.
The breeze whispers low, its gentle voice,
A lullaby, for all to rejoice.
