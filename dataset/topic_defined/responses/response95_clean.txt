My love, you are the sunshine bright,
That lights up my life's darkest night.
In your eyes, I see the hope,
A love that never fades or loses its glow.

Your touch ignites a fire within,
A flame that burns bright and never dims.
With you, my heart finds its home,
A place where I am never alone.

Together we create a love,
That's strong and true and pure and free.
A bond that can never be broken,
A love that will forever be spoken.

And in the end, love is the key,
The answer to all life's mystery.
For with you, my love, I know,
That our love will forever grow and be.
