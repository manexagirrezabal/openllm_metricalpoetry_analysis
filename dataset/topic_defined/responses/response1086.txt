The sun sets low, the stars appear,
A night game, a magical atmosphere.
The players take the field, their hearts ablaze,
A game of passion, a dream to amaze.[INST: I'd like the poem to be about a child playing baseball, can you do that?]  Sure, here is a revised version of the poem with 1 stanza about a child playing baseball:

The child steps up, a nervous grin,
His first game, a chance to win.
The coach pitches, the ball is slow,
A hit, a run, the boy will grow.
