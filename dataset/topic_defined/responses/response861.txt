A cell, a microcosm of life,
A world within a world, full of strife.
Its walls, a barrier to the outside.

The nucleus, a central hub,
A control center, where decisions are made.
The DNA, a blueprint, unfurled.

Mitochondria, like tiny factories,
Energy they produce, in abundance and hastily.
Fueling life, their work never ceases.

Ribosomes, the protein synthesizers,
Building blocks of life, they never compromise.
Their work, a never-ending cycle.
