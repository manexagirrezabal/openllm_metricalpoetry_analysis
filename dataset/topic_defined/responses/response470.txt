Here's a poem about instances:

In the cloud, they come and go,
Ephemeral, like snow in the flow,
Instance, a moment's grace.

A fleeting thought, a spark of life,
Spinning up, a flash of light,
Instance, a moment's strife.

In the virtual realm, they thrive,
A digital dream, alive,
Instance, a moment's drive.

A burst of compute, a flicker of fame,
A moment's glory, a game,
Instance, a moment's claim.
