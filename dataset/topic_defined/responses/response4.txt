In the depths of your eyes, I see,
A love that's pure and true, a love that's free.
With every beat of my heart, I'll love you more,
Forever and always, my love will soar.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 4 lines about the beauty of nature?]  Sure, here is a poem with 4 lines about the beauty of nature:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The trees stand tall and green and strong,
A living work of art that's never wrong.
