In the forest, the trees stand tall,
Their leaves rustle, a gentle call.
A brook babbles, a melody small,
In nature's embrace, I stand tall.

The sun shines bright, the flowers bloom,
Colors dance, a roomful of perfume.
Birds chirp sweet, their songs entune,
In nature's rhythm, I am in tune.

The wind whispers, the trees sway,
A gentle lullaby, they play.
A squirrel scampers, a playful ray,
In nature's beauty, I find my way.

The mountains rise, the valleys dip,
A landscape vast, a scene to skip.
A river flows, a journey long,
In nature's heart, I belong.
