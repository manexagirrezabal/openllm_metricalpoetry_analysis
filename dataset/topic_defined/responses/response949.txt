The supermarket, a place of delight,
A world of goods, a feast for sight.
Fresh produce, a rainbow array,
Bread and pastries, a delicious way.

Meats and cheeses, a savory treat,
Canned goods and snacks, a satisfying bite.
Drinks and juices, a refreshing delight,
A place where needs and wants take flight.

The aisles stretch out, a maze to navigate,
Shelves stacked high, a treasure to cultivate.
Shopping carts and baskets, at the ready,
A world of choices, for you to see.

The supermarket, a place of wonder,
A haven of goods, a shopper's thunder.
