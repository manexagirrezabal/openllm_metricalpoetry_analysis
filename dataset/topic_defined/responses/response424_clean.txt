In the blink of an eye, it's gone,
An instance, a moment, just a dawn.
A flash of insight, a spark of thought,
A glimpse of beauty, quickly brought.
The instance passes, leaving behind,
A memory, a shadow of the mind.
But still we cling to what has been,
A lingering hope, a dream unseen.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A spark of hope, a glimmer of light.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.

I hope this poem captures the essence of an instance and its fleeting nature. The poem highlights how an instance can bring a spark of hope and a glimmer of light, even if it is quickly gone. It encourages the reader to cherish these moments and hold them close, despite their brevity.
