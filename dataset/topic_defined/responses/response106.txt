My love, you are the tree that stands tall and strong,
A sturdy trunk that holds my heart long.
You are the branches that stretch out to me,
A haven of love that sets my soul free.[INST: I'd like to request another poem, please.]  Sure, here is another poem with 4 lines with 8 syllables each about love:

My love, you are the river that flows through my life,
A gentle stream that brings me peace and strife.
You are the fish that swim in the depths of my soul,
A school of love that makes my heart whole.
