Attention, oh attention, a treasure so rare
A gift we crave, a treasure beyond compare
In a world full of noise, it's a precious find
A moment's peace, a gentle breeze that aligns

We search for it, we seek and we yearn
A connection, a bond, a gentle concern
In the chaos, we crave its embrace
A moment's notice, a smile on our face

But attention's a thief, it slips away
Leaving us grasping, begging to stay
It dances and teases, it plays and flirts
Leaving us wanting, in endless pursuit

So we cry out, we plead and we pray
For just a moment, a glimmer of ray
Of attention's light, of its shining grace
To feel seen, heard, to find our place.
