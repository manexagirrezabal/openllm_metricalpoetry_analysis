The forest sings, its melody so sweet,
A chorus grand, a symphony unique.
The trees stand tall, their spirits free,
In nature's embrace, they dance with glee.

The flowers bloom, their colors bright and bold,
A vibrant palette, a wondrous hold.
They dance in breeze, they sway with grace,
In nature's beauty, I find my place.

The river flows, its journey long and wide,
A path of life, it glides and slides.
Its waters clear, its spirit free,
In nature's heart, it finds its glee.

The sun shines bright, its rays so warm and light,
A gentle touch, a guiding sight.
The clouds float by, their shapes so fine,
In nature's grace, they dance in rhyme.
