Aisles upon aisles of products so bright,
Fresh produce and meats, a feast for the sight.
Canned goods and snacks, oh so plenty,
Bread and baked treats, a sweet array.

The hum of the fridges, a symphony in store,
Shelves stacked high, a treasure trove.
Shopping carts and baskets, at the ready,
A world of goods, for you to see.

The supermarket, a place of wonder,
A haven of choice, for all to ponder.
So come and explore, take your time,
And find what you need, in this retail rhyme.
