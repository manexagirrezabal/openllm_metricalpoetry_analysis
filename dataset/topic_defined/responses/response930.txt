In the supermarket, oh so bright
Aisles upon aisles, a wondrous sight
Fresh produce, stacked high and neat
A feast for the senses, a treat to eat

The hum of the refrigerators, a gentle sound
The rustle of bags, a symphony all around
The supermarket, a place of delight
Where shopping is a joy, day or night.
