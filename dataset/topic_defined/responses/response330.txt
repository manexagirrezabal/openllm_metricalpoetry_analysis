Death, a mystery we all must face
A final journey to an unknown place
Our lives, a fleeting moment in time
A fragile existence, like a candle's shine

The grave, a silent and dark abode
Where the departed rest, their souls unload
Eternal sleep, a peaceful reprieve
From life's struggles, pain, and grief

In death, our stories all unfold
A tale of love, laughter, tears, and gold
A journey through the ages, we'll be told
Of lives lived, dreams, and moments bold

Death, a reminder to live each day
To cherish love, and never stray
For in the end, it's not what we say
But how we live, that truly stays.
