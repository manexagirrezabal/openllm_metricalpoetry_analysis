A cell, a tiny universe,
A world within a world, full of wonder and might.
Its walls, a membrane, thin and bright.

The nucleus, a central star,
A source of light, life's beginnings have started.
The DNA, a code, forever imprinted in the heart.

Mitochondria, like tiny engines,
Energy they produce, in abundance and wondrous deeds.
Fueling life, their work never ceases or slows.

Ribosomes, the protein architects,
Building blocks of life, no room for errors or flaws.
Their work, a never-ending symphony of life's constructs, forever in awe.
