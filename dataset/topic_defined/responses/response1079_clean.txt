The runner takes, a base he can improve.
The umpire calls the strike, it's fair and square,
The game is tied, the tension's in the air.
A double play, a sweet melody,
The fans are on their feet, they're in harmony.
The sun sets slow, the game's in full swing,
The players give their all, they're in the ring.
