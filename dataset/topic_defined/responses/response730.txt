A year, a cycle, a measure of time
A season for growth, a season to shine
A chance to learn, a chance to climb

The days go by, the weeks pass too
A year of moments, a year of truth
A year of laughter, a year of tears

The sun rises high, the moon glows bright
A year of wonder, a year of might
A year of dreams, a year of fights

The clock ticks away, the calendar turns
A year of memories, a year that burns
A year of love, a year of concern
