Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Guiding me through the darkest night and light.
In your eyes, my heart finds a home,
With you, my love will forever roam.

Your touch ignites a fire within,
Melting my fears and soothing my skin and win.
With every kiss, my love for you grows,
Together, our love will forever glows.

You are the sunshine in my day,
Bringing light and joy in every way and say.
In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
My love for you will forever embrace and grace.

Love is a journey we'll take with faith,
Hand in hand, we'll face life's ups and downs with pace and grace.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
My love for you will forever be won and done.
