The supermarket's doors, they open wide
A world of wonder, inside
Aisles of treasures, morning till night
A feast for senses, a delightful sight

The shoppers' carts, they fill with glee
A bounty of goods, for all to see
From fresh produce, to snacks so fine
A supermarket's treasures, all intertwine

In the produce section, oh so bright
Nature's finest, a wondrous sight
Fruits and veggies, a healthy dream
Freshness abounds, in all they seem

The supermarket's magic, never fades
A place where hunger, is always sated
So let us shop, and cook with cheer
In the supermarket, a wonderland so dear.
