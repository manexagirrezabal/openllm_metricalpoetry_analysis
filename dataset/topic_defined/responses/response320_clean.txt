Death, a mystery we all must face
A final farewell to this mortal place
Our souls depart, leaving flesh behind
A journey to the other side, we'll find

The grave, a resting place for bones
A silence where our lives are gone
Yet memories of us linger on
In loved ones' hearts, our spirits live

The end, a time for final sleep
A peaceful dreamless slumber deep
No pain, no sorrow, no more fears
Just eternal rest, no tears to shed

But as we lay beneath the ground
Our stories, legacies profound
Live on in those who come after
Death's not end, but a new chapter.
