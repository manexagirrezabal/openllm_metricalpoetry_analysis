The umpire calls, the players respond,
A strike, a ball, the game's momentum shifts.
The crowd cheers loud, a home run is hit,
The team's spirit, a boost, a bit.
The shortstop turns, a double play,
The outfielders throw, a runner's way.
The game of baseball, a test of might,
A battle of wills, a clash of light.
