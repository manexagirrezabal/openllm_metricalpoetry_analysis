Here's another short poem about an instance:

I am a moment in time, a snapshot,
A singular instance, a rhyme in thought.
I exist for a brief second, then gone,
A flash of life, a burst of dawn.
But in this instant, I am free,
A spark of joy, a wild, carefree.
I am a single instance, pure and true,
A fleeting thought, a moment anew.
