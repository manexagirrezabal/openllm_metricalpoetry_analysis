My love, you are the missing piece,
The one that makes my heart complete.
In your arms, I find my home,
A place where I am never alone.

Your smile is the brightest light,
That shines in the darkest night.
With you, my heart takes flight,
And soars to unreachable heights.

Together we create a love,
That's strong and pure and true.
A bond that can never be broken,
A love that will forever shine through.

And in the end, love is the key,
The answer to all life's mystery.
For with you, my love, I know,
That our love will forever grow.
