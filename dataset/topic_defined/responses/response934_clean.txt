In the supermarket, a world of delight
A cornucopia of goods, a wondrous sight
Fresh produce, a symphony of hues
A feast for the senses, all the news

The bakery section, a sweet serenade
A world of pastries, never to be made
The supermarket, a place of joy
Where shopping is a pleasure, boy or girl.
