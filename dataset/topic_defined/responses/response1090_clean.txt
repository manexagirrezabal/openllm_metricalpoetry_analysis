A diamond in the grass, a game of skill,
The crack of bat and ball, a thrill.
The pitcher winds up, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the crowd sings.

The outfielders race, the infielders dive,
A double play, the game alive.
The umpire calls, the managers shout,
It's baseball, America's favorite bout.
