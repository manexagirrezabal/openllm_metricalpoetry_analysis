My love, you are the flower that blooms in my heart,
A beauty that never departs.
You are the dew that quenches every thirst,
A love that's pure and just.

Your touch is like a gentle summer rain,
Soothing my soul again.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will reign supreme.
