Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, the future can unfold,
A mystery solved, a new story to be told.
What was once unknown now becomes clear,
A path illuminated, without fear.

An instance can be a time to choose,
A crossroads met, a new path to propose.
It's a chance to make a difference, to take a stand,
To write a new chapter in the land.

In an instant, we can find our strength,
A resilience that will forever length.
It's a time to rise above the pain,
To let go of fear, to love again.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
A chance to bloom, a new destiny.
To embrace the moment with open heart,
To dance with life, a brand new start.
