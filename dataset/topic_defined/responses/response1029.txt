Carts rumble, baskets sway
Fresh bread wafts, mouths water play
Aisles stretch, shoppers dart and weave
Satisfying hauls, lives to retrieve

But now, the nostalgia seeps in
Memories of trips with Grandma pin
The smell of freshly baked bread
Fills the air, a happy dread

Shelves stocked, goods galore
Shoppers dash, minutes before
Closing time, the final call
Emptiness, the mall's fall

Trolleys rumble, baskets sway
Fresh produce beckons, shoppers' way
Aisles stretch, shoppers dart and play
Satisfying hauls, end the day

Fluorescent lights, a bright display
Racks of clothes, a colorful array
Bargains abound, shoppers' delight
Shopping carts, hopes take flight

Aisles of wonder, rows of joy
Fresh bread wafts, mouths employ
Canned and boxed, treats galore
Satisfying meals, and more
