The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A golden light that makes me sigh.
The grass is green and soft to touch,
A place where dreams and memories are clutched.

The crack of bat against ball,
Echoes through the stadium tall.
The roar of crowds and cheerful shouts,
As players give their all and devout.

The pitcher winds up, ready to throw,
The batter swings, the ball will go.
A hit, a run, the game is won,
The joy of baseball has just begun.

The final inning, bottom of the nine,
The home team trails by two runs fine.
A rally starts, the crowd gets loud,
A comeback story unfolds.
