A place of abundance, a treat for the soul
Fresh flowers and plants, a vibrant goal
Carts filled with love, a heartfelt role
Supermarket beauty, a work of art[INST: Can you do it in sonnet form?]  Sure, here's a sonnet about supermarket:

Amidst the aisles of plenty, I do stroll
Where shelves of treats and goodies doth unfold
Fresh fruits and veggies, meats and fish, all whole
A feast for eyes and belly, young and old

Carts filled with bread and pastries, sweet delight
Canned goods and snacks, a wondrous sight
Fragrant flowers and plants, a vibrant light
A supermarket full of beauty and might[INST: Can you do it in a different form?]  Sure! Here's a haiku about supermarket:

Aisles of plenty
Fresh foods and treats galore
Supermarket joy
