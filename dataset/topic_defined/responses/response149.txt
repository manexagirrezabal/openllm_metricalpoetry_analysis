The forest awakens, a new day begins,
Birds sing sweet melodies, their voices entwine.
The dew on the grass, a morning mist,
A refreshing start, a pure delight.
The trees stand tall, their leaves a vibrant hue,
Nature's canvas, a work of art anew.
The breeze whispers through, a gentle caress,
A symphony of life, a peacefulness to bless.
