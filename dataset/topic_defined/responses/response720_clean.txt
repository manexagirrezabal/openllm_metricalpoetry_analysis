A year, a span of time so dear,
A cycle of seasons, a rhyme.
From budding springs to fiery summers,
To autumn's harvest, and winter's slumber.

The months, they pass, each one a gem,
A story told, a chapter's theme.
From new beginnings to cherished ends,
A year, a journey, and all that transpires.

The days, they dawn, they dusk, they fade,
A canvas painted, a tale displayed.
With laughter, tears, and moments made,
A year, a treasure, forever played.

The hours, they tick, they tock, they chime,
A symphony of life's rhyme.
A dance of seconds, a beat of time,
A year, a melody, sublime.
