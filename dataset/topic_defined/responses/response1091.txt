The sun shines bright, the grass is green,
A game of baseball, a scene serene.
The players warm up, the crowd cheers,
It's time to play, the game's in gear.

The crack of bat, the ball takes flight,
A home run, oh what a sight.
The fans jump up, they cheer and clap,
It's baseball, a sport to capture the map.
