My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
Warming my heart and brightening my way.
With your smile, my world is filled with light,
And my life is filled with joy and delight.

Your touch ignites a fire deep within me,
Melting my fears and setting my soul free.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A love that fills my heart and overflows to you.

Together we dance, hand in hand,
Savoring each moment, lost in the land of love.
Our hearts beat as one, our souls entwined,
In this world of ours, our love shines divine.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let go of the love we hold dear.
For with you by my side, my love, I know,
That our love will forever glow and grow.
