In the supermarket, a world of choice
A cornucopia of goods, a consumer's voice
Fresh bread, aromatic and warm
A treat for the taste buds, never to harm

The fruit stands, a rainbow hue
A symphony of flavors, waiting for you
The supermarket, a place of delight
Where shopping is a joy, day or night.
