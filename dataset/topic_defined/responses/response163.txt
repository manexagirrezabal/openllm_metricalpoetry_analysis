The ocean waves, a symphony of sound
A rhythm soothing, a melody all around
The tides, they rise and fall
A dance of life, a story to enthrall

The sea creatures, a diverse band
A world of wonder, a treasure to expand
The coral reefs, a colorful sight
A world within a world, a beauty so bright

The beach, a place of peace and calm
A haven for rest, a moment to disarm
The sand, it shifts, a changing shape
A reminder of life's fleeting escape

In nature's embrace, I find my home
A place of solace, a life of my own[INST: Can you write me a poem with 14 lines about the beauty of a woman?]  Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines about the beauty of a woman:

Her eyes, they shine, a sparkling light
A window to her soul, a beauty in sight
Her smile, it glows, a radiant beam
A warmth that spreads, a dream so serene

Her hair, it flows, a river of gold
A cascade of elegance, a story to be told
Her skin, it glows, a gentle hue
A canvas of grace, a work of art anew

Her lips, they curve, a sweet delight
A promise of love, a tender kiss goodnight
Her voice, it whispers, a gentle breeze
A melody of love, a symphony of ease

In her beauty, I find my peace
A sense of wonder, a world to cease
From the strife and noise of city's release
I find solace, in her gentle ease.
