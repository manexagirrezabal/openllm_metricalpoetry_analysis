A spark of creativity,
A flash of inspiration,
An instance of imagination,
In this moment of creation.

The canvas is blank,
The page is pure,
A moment's potential,
In this instance's allure.[INST: I'd like to request another poem, please.]  Sure, here's another poem with 2 stanzas about instance:

A tick of the clock,
A beat of the heart,
An instance of time,
That sets us apart.

The moments accumulate,
The years go by,
A lifetime of memories,
In this instance's sigh.
