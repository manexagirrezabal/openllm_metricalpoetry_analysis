Attention, oh attention, a treasure so fine
A gift we crave, a treasure divine
In a world full of noise, it's a rare find
A moment's peace, a gentle wind

We search for it, we chase and we seek
A connection, a bond, a gentle sneak
In the chaos, we yearn for its grace
A moment's notice, a smile on our face

But attention's a thief, it slips away
Leaving us grasping, begging to stay
It teases and taunts, it dances and plays
Leaving us wanting, in endless pursuit

So we shout, we cry, we plead and we pray
For just a moment, a glimmer of ray
Of attention's light, of its shining grace
To feel seen, heard, to find our place.
