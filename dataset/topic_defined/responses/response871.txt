In the palm of my hand, a small device,
A world of knowledge, a universe to perceive.
With just a touch, a swipe, a tap,
I'm connected to the world, and all its maps.

Through walls of glass and steel, it guides me,
To places far and wide, it takes me.
With every step, a new horizon unfurls,
My cell, a compass, a map, it twirls.

In the silence of night, it whispers low,
A gentle voice, a private show.
It tells me tales of love and strife,
My cell, a confidant, a life.

And in the end, when all is said,
My cell, a loyal friend, a bond that's wed.
