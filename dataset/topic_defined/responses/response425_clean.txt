An instance, oh so brief,
A moment in time, a glimpse of belief.
A snapshot in the mind, a fleeting thought,
A flash of insight, brought to naught.
The instance passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A spark of hope, a glimmer of light.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.

I hope this poem captures the essence of an instance and its fleeting nature. The poem highlights how an instance can bring a spark of hope and a glimmer of light, even if it is quickly gone. It encourages the reader to cherish these moments and hold them close, despite their brevity.

Here's a revised version of the poem with 14 lines:

An instance, oh so brief,
A moment in time, a glimpse of belief.
A snapshot in the mind, a fleeting thought,
A flash of insight, brought to naught.
The instance passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A spark of hope, a glimmer of light.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.

I hope this revised version captures the essence of an instance even better. The poem emphasizes the importance of cherishing these fleeting moments and holding them close, despite their brevity. It also highlights how instances can bring a spark of hope and a glimmer of light, making them grand and special.
