In the stillness of the moment's heart,
I found a peace that would never part,
A quiet, gentle, loving embrace,
That filled my soul with grace.

In that instant's flash of light,
I saw the world with new eyes bright,
A fresh beginning, a clean slate,
A chance to create my own fate.

And so, I embraced the instance's grace,
And let it guide me to a brand new place,
Where I could be myself, free and true,
A moment of clarity, pure and new.
