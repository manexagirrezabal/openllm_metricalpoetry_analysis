My love, you are the river that flows,
Ever changing, yet forever grows.
You are the bridge that spans the distance,
Connecting our hearts in a love so resistance.
In your eyes, I see a love so deep,
A love that's unbreakable, a heart that beats.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
