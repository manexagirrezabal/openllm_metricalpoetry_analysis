My love, you are the star that shines so bright,
A beacon in the night.
You are the calm in every stormy sea,
A shelter from the rain and snow for me.

Your touch is like a gentle summer breeze,
Soothing my soul with ease.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will soar and sing.
