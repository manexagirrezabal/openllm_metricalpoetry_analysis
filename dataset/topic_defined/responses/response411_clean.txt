Here's another short poem about an instance:

A single moment, frozen in time,
An instance, a snapshot, a rhyme.
I am a drop in the ocean's tide,
A grain of sand on a vast beachside.
But in this instant, I am alive,
A spark of life, a flash of drive.
I exist for a moment, pure and true,
A singular instance, that's all I do.
