A cell, a cage, a prison small,
A place to hold, a soul to enthrall.
A space that's bare, a floor that's cold,
A room that's harsh, where freedom's told.

The walls are high, the bars are strong,
The only light, a faint, weak song.
A bed that's hard, a blanket that's thin,
A cell that's cruel, where hope's held within.
