Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, the world can change its tune,
A new melody, a different moon.
What was once a dream can now come true,
A possibility realized, that's new.

An instance can be a time to grow,
A moment seized, a new way to know.
It's a chance to break the mold, to shatter fears,
To embrace the moment with open ears.

In an instant, we can find our voice,
A message clear, a choice to rejoice.
It's a time to let go of doubt and pain,
And embrace the moment, without a strain.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
A chance to bloom, a new destiny.
To embrace the moment with open heart,
To dance with life, a brand new start.
