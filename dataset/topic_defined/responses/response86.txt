Love is a river that flows so deep,
A feeling that we can't conceal,
It's the beat of our hearts, it's what we seek.

You are my sunshine in the rain,
My shelter from life's stormy pain,
With you, my love remains, like a refrain.

In your eyes, my heart finds peace,
A love so true, it never ceases,
With you, my soul releases, like a lease.

Together we create a love so pure,
A bond that endures for sure,
Forever and always, our love endures, like a cure.
