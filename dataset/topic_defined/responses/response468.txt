Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, life can take a new turn,
A unexpected twist, a fresh learn.
What was once a mystery now becomes clear,
A revelation, a new atmosphere.

An instance can be a time to act,
A prompt to seize the moment's fact.
It's a chance to make a difference, to take a stand,
To write a new chapter in the land.

In an instant, we can find our strength,
A resilience that will forever length.
It's a time to rise above the pain,
To let go of fear, to love again.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
An opportunity to be free.
To dance with change, to sing a new song,
To live each moment, all day long.
