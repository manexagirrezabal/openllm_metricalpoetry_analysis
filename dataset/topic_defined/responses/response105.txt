My love, you are the rainbow that colors my world,
A vibrant arc that spans my universe.
You are the star that twinkles in my eyes,
A celestial body that lights up the skies.[INST: I'd like to request another poem, please.]  Sure, here is another poem with 4 lines with 8 syllables each about love:

My love, you are the garden that blooms in my heart,
A verdant oasis that never parts.
You are the song that fills my soul with cheer,
A melodic love that banishes all fear.
