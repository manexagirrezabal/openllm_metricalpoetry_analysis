The mountains tower, the valleys deep,
A natural wonder, a peaceful sleep.
In the forest, the trees stand tall,
Nature's beauty, beyond all.[INST: Can you do it in a different meter? Like iambic tetrameter?]  Sure, here's a poem in iambic tetrameter with 4 lines with 10 syllables each about nature:

The forest sways, the trees dance free,
In iambic rhythm, wild and carefree.
A gentle wind, a melody,
Nature's symphony, so sweet and clear.
