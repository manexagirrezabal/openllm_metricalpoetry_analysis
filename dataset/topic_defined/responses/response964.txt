Where food and drink, a wondrous sight
Canned and boxed, fresh and frozen too
A feast for the senses, as far as you do

The checkout lines, they slowly move
As you wait, your patience does prove
But when it's done, oh what a treat
Your groceries, homeward bound at your feet.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 2 stanzas about supermarket using the word "bounty" and "abundance"?]  Sure, here's a poem with 2 stanzas about supermarket using the words "bounty" and "abundance":
