The mountains rise, their peaks touch the sky,
A towering grandeur, they stand and sigh.
Their slopes are clothed, in greenery so bright,
In nature's splendor, they dance with delight.

The valleys below, a verdant hue,
A carpet soft, a landscape anew.
The rivers flow, their waters pure and clear,
In nature's beauty, they banish fear.

The forest sings, its melody so sweet,
A chorus grand, a symphony unique.
The trees stand tall, their spirits free,
In nature's embrace, they dance with glee.

The sun shines bright, its rays so warm and light,
A gentle touch, a guiding sight.
The clouds float by, their shapes so fine,
In nature's grace, they dance in rhyme.
