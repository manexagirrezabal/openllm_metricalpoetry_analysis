A cell, a small, enclosed space,
A world within a larger place.
A place where life is lived, a soul that's free,
A space that's meant to be, for all eternity.

The walls that confine, so strong and thick,
A cage that holds a heart, a spirit that's quick.
The floor that's hard, the ceiling low,
A space that's bare, with nothing to show.

But in this cell, there's hope that shines,
A light that glows, a love that's divine.
The days that pass, the nights that fall,
A life that's lived, with no regrets at all.

For in this cell, there's peace that reigns,
A soul that's free, a heart that sustains.
A place where dreams are made, where love resides,
A cell that's home, where the spirit abides.
