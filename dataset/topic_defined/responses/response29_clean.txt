My love, you are the missing piece I never knew,
The one that makes my heart whole and true.
You are the bridge that spans the distance between,
Connecting our souls in a love that's clean.

Your touch is like a warm ray of sunshine bright,
Illuminating my world with delight.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will soar and sing.
