The grass is green, the sky is blue,
A perfect day for baseball, that's true.
The players warm up, they stretch and run,
The game's about to start, everyone's won.
The pitcher throws, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the game's spirits sing.
The infielders dive, the outfielders race,
A double play, a triple ace, they embrace.
