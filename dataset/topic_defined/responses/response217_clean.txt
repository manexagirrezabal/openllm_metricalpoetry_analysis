In the forest, the trees stand tall,
Their leaves rustling, a gentle call.
A brook babbles, a melody small.

The sun shines bright, the flowers bloom,
Colors vibrant, a room to swoon.
A gentle breeze, a peaceful boom.

The trees sway, a gentle dance,
Their branches entwined in a chance.
The birds sing, a joyous trance.

In the meadow, the grass is green,
A carpet soft, a scene serene.
The wildflowers, a colorful sheen.
