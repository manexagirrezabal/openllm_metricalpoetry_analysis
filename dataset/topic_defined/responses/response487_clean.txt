In the midst of life's chaotic fray,
I found an instant's peaceful sway,
A moment's reprieve from the noise and din,
A chance to breathe, to let my heart win.

In that instant's quiet, I heard a voice,
A whisper of wisdom, a gentle, sweet rejoice,
A message of hope, a ray of light,
A guide to help me navigate the night.

And so, I embraced the instance's grace,
And let it fill my soul with peace and space,
A moment of clarity, pure and true,
A glimpse into the depths anew.
