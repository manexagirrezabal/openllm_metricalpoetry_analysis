In the swirling vortex of life's dance,
I twirled and swayed, chance by chance,
The world around me, a blurred haze,
As I spun round in my own daze.

But then, in an instant, all changed,
My perspective shifted, my thoughts arranged,
A moment of clarity, pure and true,
A glimpse into the depths anew.

In that instance's flash of light,
I saw the world with new eyes bright,
A fresh beginning, a clean slate,
A chance to create my own fate.
