Attention, oh attention, a treasure so rare,
A gift we all seek, yet often unaware.
In this world of distractions, it's hard to maintain,
A focus that's pure, and a mind that's profane.

The whispers of temptation, they lure us away,
From the tasks that are vital, to play.
The shiny objects of desire, they catch our eye,
And we chase after them, with a sigh.

But attention is power, it's a gift from above,
To focus on what matters, and to show love.
For those who can harness it, the rewards are great,
A life that's well-lived, with no regrets or hate.

So let us strive for attention, with purpose and might,
To cultivate mindfulness, day and night.
