The sun rises high, the sky a brilliant blue,
A new day dawns, a fresh start anew.
The birds take flight, their songs so sweet and true,
In nature's embrace, my spirit renews.

The trees stand tall, their leaves rustle and sway,
A gentle breeze stirs, a peaceful bay.
Their branches stretch, their roots run deep,
In nature's heart, my soul finds its keep.

The flowers bloom, their colors bright and bold,
A vibrant palette, a wondrous hold.
They dance in breeze, they sway with grace,
In nature's beauty, I find my place.

The river flows, its journey long and wide,
A path of life, it glides and slides.
Its waters clear, its spirit free,
In nature's heart, it finds its glee.
