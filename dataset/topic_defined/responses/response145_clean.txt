The snowflakes fall, a winter's tale,
A blanket of white, a scene so frail.
The trees stand bare, their branches stark,
A season's slumber, a time to embark.
The frozen pond, a sheet of ice,
A canvas for skaters, a joyous vice.
The stars twinkle bright, a night so clear,
A celestial show, a wonder to hear.
