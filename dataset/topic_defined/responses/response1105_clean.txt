The sun shines bright, the grass is green
A perfect day for baseball, it's been seen
The players take the field, their spirits high
The game begins, the crowd cheers "Let's go!"

The pitcher throws the ball, the batter swings
A hit, a run, the game's excitement rings
The infielders scramble, the outfielders race
A play is made, the crowd erupts in praise

The umpire calls the strikes, the catcher throws
The bases are loaded, the game is in tow
A steal, a slide, a cloud of dust
A run scores, the game is a must

In the bleachers, fans cheer and shout
Their team's ahead, they're on a rollout
Hot dogs and popcorn, peanuts too
The snacks are abundant, the game's anew
