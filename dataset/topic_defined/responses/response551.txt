Attention, oh attention, a gift we impart
A moment's focus, a listening heart
We give it to those who need it most
A child's smile, a lover's gentle boast

It's a bond that ties us, a thread of grace
A connection that lifts us to our place
In the world's noise, it's a refuge we find
A haven of calm, a peace of mind

Attention, oh attention, a treasure we share
A moment's joy, a love beyond compare
It's a gift we give, a debt we pay
A blessing that enriches, come what may.
