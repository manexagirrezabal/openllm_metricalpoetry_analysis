Sure, here's another short poem about instances:

Instances dance, then quickly fade,
Ephemeral, fleeting, a moment's shade.
In the virtual realm, they're alive,
A flicker of light, then lost in time.[INST: Can you do it in a different meter? Like trochaic or iambic?]  Sure, here's a short trochaic poem about instances:

Rise and fall, instances fleeting,
Ephemeral moments, quickly meeting.
In digital realms, they flash bright,
A moment's glory, lost in night.

Or how about an iambic poem?

Instances come, then go away,
Ephemeral moments, fading ray.
In virtual worlds, they briefly shine,
A flash of light, then lost in time.
