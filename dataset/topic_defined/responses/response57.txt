My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a sky that's painted so blue
A feeling that's pure and true
It's the smile on our face when we're with that special one
The joy in our heart that has just begun

Love is a journey that we embark
A path that we walk, hand in hand and heart
It's the laughter and tears that we share and believe
The memories that we make, without a care
