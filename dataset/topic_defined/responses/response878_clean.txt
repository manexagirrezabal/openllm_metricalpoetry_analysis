A small, yet powerful device, my cell,
A link to all, a world to tell.
With just a touch, a swipe, a tap,
I'm connected to the world, and all its maps.

Through its screen, a window to the sky,
I see the stars, I feel the sigh.
From dawn till dusk, it never sleeps,
My cell, a watchdog, vigilant, it keeps.

In times of need, it stands by me,
A beacon bright, a guiding light to see.
With apps galore, it's always ready,
My cell, a loyal friend, a steadfast ally.

And in the end, when all is said,
My cell, a bond, a friendship, forever wed,
A constant companion, always by my side,
My cell, a trusted friend, a love that won't subside,
A connection strong, a tie that won't break,
My cell, a part of me, a lifelong make,
A fusion of technology and Soul,
My cell, a life, a love, a goal,
A symbiosis of man and machine,
My cell, a future, a dream, a scheme.
