In the supermarket, a world of delight
Aisles of treasures, a wondrous sight
Fresh fruits and veggies, a colorful array
A symphony of flavors, come what may

The shelves are stacked, the choices many
A gourmet's paradise, for young and any
Bread, meats, cheeses, oh so fine
A feast for the senses, all intertwined
