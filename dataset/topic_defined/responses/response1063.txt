The sun sets slow, the game's alive,
The players give their all, they thrive.
The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A home run hit, the crowd can't be beat.
The infielders hustle, the outfielders too,
A double play, a triple ace, they do.
The game of baseball, a true delight,
A national pastime, a pure joy to behold in sight.
