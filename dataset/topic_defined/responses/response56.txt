My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a garden that blooms so bright
A feeling that takes flight
It's the beauty in our heart when we're with that special one
The joy in our soul that has just begun

Love is a gift that we give and receive
A treasure that we can't conceive
It's the laughter and tears that we share and believe
The memories that we make, without a care
