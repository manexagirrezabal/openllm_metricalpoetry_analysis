A cell, a cage, a prison dark,
A place to hold, a soul that's stark.
A floor that's cold, a ceiling high,
A room that's small, where freedom dies.

The walls are strong, the bars are thick,
The only light, a faint, dim trick.
A bed that's hard, a blanket that's old,
A cell that's cruel, where hope grows cold.
