A year, a span of time so grand,
A cycle of seasons, hand in hand.
From spring's new life to summer's prime,
To autumn's harvest and winter's crime.

The months, they pass, each one a gem,
A story told, a chapter's theme.
From new beginnings to cherished ends,
A year, a journey, and all that transpires.

The days, they dawn, they dusk, they shine,
A canvas painted, a life divine.
With laughter, tears, and moments shared,
A year, a treasure, forever spared.

The hours, they tick, they tock, they chime,
A symphony of life's rhyme.
A dance of seconds, a beat of time,
A year, a melody, sublime.
