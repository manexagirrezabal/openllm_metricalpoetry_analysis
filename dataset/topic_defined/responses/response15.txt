My love, you are the fire that burns so bright,
Warming my heart, and lighting up the night.
You are the spark that ignites the flame,
A love that's unbreakable, never tamed.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for you.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
