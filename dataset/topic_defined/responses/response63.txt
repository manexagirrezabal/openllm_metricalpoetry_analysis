My love, you are the sunshine that brightens up my day,
The star that guides me through the night's darkest way.
You are the calm in every storm, the shelter from the rain,
The love that makes my heart sing, and gives me joy again.

Your touch ignites a fire that never fades away,
A flame that burns bright and never loses its sway.
It's like a gentle breeze on a summer day,
A feeling that never goes away.

Together we create a love that's strong and true,
A bond that will forever be brand new.
Through laughter and through tears, we'll face it all,
Together, our love will stand tall.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let go of the love we hold dear.
For with you by my side, my love, I know,
That our love will forever glow and grow.
