My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
Warming my heart and brightening my way.
You are the star that guides me through the night,
And in your eyes, I see a love so bright.
You are the melody that fills my heart,
A symphony of joy, a work of art.
Together, we create a love so true,
Forever and always, my love, I'll be with you.
