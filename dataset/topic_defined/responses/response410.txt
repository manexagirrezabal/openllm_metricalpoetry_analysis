Here's a short poem about an instance:

In this moment, I am alive,
A singular instance, a flash of light.
I am a spark in the vast expanse,
A pinprick of consciousness in the endless night.
I exist for a brief instant, alone,
A fleeting thought in the universe's grand tome.
But in this moment, I am free,
A singular instance, wild and carefree.
