In the supermarket, the lights are bright
A world of wonder, a feast for sight
Fresh fruits and veggies, a colorful array
A symphony of flavors, come what may

The aisles are long, the choices many
A culinary adventure, for young and any
Bread, meats, cheeses, oh so fine
A gourmet's paradise, all intertwined.
