My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
A ray of hope that chases all the gray away.
You are the breeze that rustles through my hair,
A gentle caress that's always there.

Your touch ignites a fire that never fades,
A burning passion that inflames my heart and shades.
With you, my love, I feel alive,
Together we create a love that thrives and survives.

You are the melody that fills my heart,
A symphony of joy that never departs.
In your eyes, my soul finds a home,
With you, my love, I am never alone.
