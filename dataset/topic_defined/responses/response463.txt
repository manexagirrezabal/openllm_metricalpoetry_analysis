Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, the past can fade,
A memory lost, a new parade.
What was once a scar can now heal,
A wound closed, a new reveal.

An instance can be a time to love,
A moment shared, sent from above.
It's a chance to mend a broken heart,
To find a new start, a brand new art.

In an instant, we can find our voice,
A message clear, a choice to rejoice.
It's a time to let go of fear and doubt,
And embrace the moment, without a rout.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
An opportunity to be free.
To dance with change, to sing a new song,
To live each moment, all day long.
