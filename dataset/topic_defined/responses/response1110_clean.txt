Here's a poem about baseball:

The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
As the ball soars through the air, it meets
The cheers of the crowd, a joyful treat,
A home run, the ultimate thrill to beat.

The pitcher winds up, a swift motion,
Hurls the ball with all his devotion,
The batter swings, a forceful notion,
A hit, a run, the game's emotion.

The shortstop makes a play, so sly,
A double play, the crowd goes wild,
The outfielders race, a quick reply,
A catch, a throw, the game's delight.

The umpire calls, a voice so clear,
Strikes and balls, the count is near,
The manager signals, a plan so dear,
A steal, a slide, the game's cheer.
