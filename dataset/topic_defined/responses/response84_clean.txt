Love is a flower that blooms in spring,
A feeling that makes our hearts sing,
It's the joy that we cling.

You are my sunshine in the rain,
My shelter from life's stormy pain,
With you, my love remains.

In your eyes, my heart finds peace,
A love so true, it never ceases,
With you, my soul releases.

Together we create a love so pure,
A bond that endures for sure,
Forever and always, our love endures, like a cure.
