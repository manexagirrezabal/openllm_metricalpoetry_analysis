An instance, a moment in time,
A fleeting thought, a rhyme in mind.
A snapshot of life, a glimpse of truth,
A flash of insight, a path to youth.
The instance passes, but memories stay,
A lingering shadow of what we play.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A spark of hope, a glimmer of light.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.
