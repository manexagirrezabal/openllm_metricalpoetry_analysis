Death, a dark and mystery night
A passage to the other side
Where our souls will take flight

In the stillness, we'll find peace
Our pain and suffering release
A new world, our spirits increase

The grave, a place of rest
Our bodies laid to eternal nest
A final sleep, our hearts are blessed

Beyond the tomb, a new life we'll know
A journey through the afterglow
In death, our souls will forever grow.
