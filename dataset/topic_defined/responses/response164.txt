The forest sways, a gentle dance
A symphony of life, a chance to prance
The trees, they stand, a towering height
A canopy of green, a world of might

The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight
A palette pure, a painter's delight
The bees and butterflies, they flit and play
In nature's rhythm, a dance so gay

The breeze whispers low, a gentle lull
The leaves, they rustle, a soothing pull
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green
A sanctuary, a place to alight and seen

In nature's heart, I find my home
A place of peace, a life of my own[INST: Can you write me a poem with 14 lines about the beauty of a woman?]  Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines about the beauty of a woman:

Her eyes, they shine, a sparkling light
A window to her soul, a beauty in sight
Her smile, it glows, a radiant beam
A warmth that spreads, a dream so serene

Her hair, it flows, a river of gold
A cascade of elegance, a story to be told
Her skin, it glows, a gentle hue
A canvas of grace, a work of art anew

Her lips, they curve, a sweet delight
A promise of love, a tender kiss goodnight
Her voice, it whispers, a gentle breeze
A melody of love, a symphony of ease

In her beauty, I find my peace
A sense of wonder, a world to cease
From the strife and noise of city's release
I find solace, in her gentle ease.
