A brand new year, a fresh start
A time for hopes, a time for heart
The old is gone, the new begins
A chance to make amends

The days go by, the weeks fly past
The months disappear, the years go fast
The clock ticks on, the baby grows
A new year brings new woes

The sun sets slow, the stars come out
The night is still, the world is devout
The fireworks burst, the champagne flows
A new year brings new vows

But as the years go by, I realize
Time's a thief, it steals our prize
Youth slips away, life takes its toll
A new year brings new goals
