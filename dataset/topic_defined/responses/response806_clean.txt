A cell, a room, a space so small,
A place to keep, a soul that's frail.
A floor that's hard, a ceiling low,
A room that's bare, where freedom's slow.

The walls are cold, the bars are strong,
The only sound, a faint, sad song.
A bed that's narrow, a blanket that's thin,
A cell that's harsh, where hope's held within.
