The mountains rise, a towering sight,
A challenge to climb, with all their might.
Their peaks, they touch the sky so high,
A home for eagles, up in the blue on high.[INST: Please write me a poem with 4 lines about nature]  Sure, here is a four-line poem about nature:

The forest sings, a gentle melody,
A chorus of birds, a rustling symphony.
The trees, they sway, in rhythm with the breeze,
A natural concert, for all to seize.
