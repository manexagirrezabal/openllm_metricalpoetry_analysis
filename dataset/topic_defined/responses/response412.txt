Here's another short poem about an instance:

In the blink of an eye, I appear,
A fleeting moment, a flash of cheer.
I am a single instance, unique and rare,
A snowflake falling through the air.
I exist for a moment, then fade away,
A singular instance, gone with the fray.
But in this instant, I am alive,
A spark of life, a flash of drive.
