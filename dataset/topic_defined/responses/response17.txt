My love, you are the ocean's tide,
Ebbing and flowing, by my side.
You are the waves that gently roll,
Soothing my soul, and making my heart whole.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for you.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
