In the silence, our love speaks loud,
A language that only our hearts can proud.
With every glance, our love shines bright,
Together, our love will light up the night.[INST: ]  Sure, here is a poem with 1 stanza about love:

Our love is a garden, blooming with care,
Nurtured by kisses and moments we share.
With every petal, our love grows strong,
Together, our love will forever belong.
