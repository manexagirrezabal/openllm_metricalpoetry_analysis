The supermarket, a place of wonder,
A world of goods, in a single thunder.
Fresh produce, a feast for the eyes,
Bread and baked treats, a sweet surprise.

Meats and cheeses, a savory delight,
Canned goods and snacks, a satisfying bite.
Drinks and juices, a refreshing treat,
A place where needs and wants meet.

The aisles stretch out, a maze to explore,
Shelves stacked high, a treasure trove in store.
Shopping carts and baskets, at the ready,
A world of choices, for you to see.

The supermarket, a place of joy,
Where shopping lists and dreams employ.
