My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
A ray of light that chases all the gray away.
You are the calm in every stormy sea,
The safe haven where I can be free.

Your touch ignites a fire deep within,
A flame that burns bright and never dims.
With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love so sweet.

In your eyes, my heart finds a home,
A place where I am never alone.
With every kiss, our love grows strong,
A bond that can never be wrong.

And in the end, love is the key,
The answer to all life's mystery.
For with you, my love, I know,
That our love will forever grow.
