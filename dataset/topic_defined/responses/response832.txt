A cell, a tiny building block of life,
A microscopic world, full of endless strife.
Within its walls, a story unfolds,
Of growth, division, and forever told.

Inside the cell, a symphony plays,
A dance of molecules, in endless ways.
The DNA, a twisted cord,
A blueprint for life, forever stored.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 2 stanzas about cell division?]  Sure, here's a poem with 2 stanzas about cell division:

Cell division, a process so grand,
A miracle of life, within the land.
The cell, it grows, it splits in two,
A perfect replica, for all to view.

Inside the cell, a flurry of activity,
A dance of molecules, in perfect harmony.
The chromosomes, they line up with care,
The mitotic spindle, it's there to share.
