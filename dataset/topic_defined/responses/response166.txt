The mountains rise, a towering height
A rugged landscape, a sight so bright
The snow-capped peaks, a gleaming light
A challenge to climb, a journey through the night

The valleys below, a verdant scene
A haven for life, a place to be seen
The rivers flow, a gentle stream
A source of life, a dream so serene

The sky above, a canvas grand
A work of art, a master's hand
The clouds, they drift, a changing shape
A reflection of life, a moment to escape

In nature's beauty, I find my peace
A sense of awe, a world to cease
From the strife and noise of city's release
I find solace, in nature's gentle ease.
