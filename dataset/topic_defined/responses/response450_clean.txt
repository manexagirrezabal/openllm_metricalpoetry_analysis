In the virtual realm, they rise,
Ephemeral, fleeting, in the skies.
Instances, born of code and art,
Serving purposes, within their part.

Their lives are brief, their fate is sealed,
Once their task is done, they're revealed.
But in their moment, they shine bright,
A spark of life, a flash of light.

In the datacenters, they reside,
A swarm of instances, side by side.
Working tirelessly, day and night,
Processing data, with all their might.

They come and go, like waves on shore,
Leaving no trace, forever more.
Yet in their wake, they leave behind,
A trail of progress, a digital find.
