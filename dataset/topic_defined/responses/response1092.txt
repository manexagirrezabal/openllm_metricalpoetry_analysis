The field is alive, with action all around,
A game of skill, a test of strength profound.
The pitcher throws, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the game's wings.

The outfielders race, the infielders dive,
A double play, the game alive.
The umpire calls, the managers shout,
It's baseball, America's favorite bout.
