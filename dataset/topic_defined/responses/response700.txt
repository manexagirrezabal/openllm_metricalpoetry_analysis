A year, a span of time so bright,
A cycle of seasons, a chance to ignite.
From budding flowers to harvest delight,
It's a journey that brings us new light.

The months go by, each one a gem,
A story of growth, a tale to gleam.
From frosty winter to summer's warmth,
It's a year of change, a chance to be reborn.
