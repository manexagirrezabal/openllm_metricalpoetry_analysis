In the forest, the trees stand tall,
Their leaves rustling, a gentle call.
A brook babbles, its water clear,
Flowers bloom, their colors near.

The sky above, a brilliant blue,
Birds singing, their songs anew.
The sun shines down, its rays so bright,
A gentle breeze, a welcome sight.

In the meadow, wildflowers sway,
Butterflies dance, in playful array.
The grass whispers, a soft melody,
Bees buzz, collecting nectar with glee.

At dusk, the fireflies appear,
Their lights flickering, without fear.
The stars twinkle, their nightly show,
A peaceful scene, for all to know.
