The crowd cheers loud, the players thrill,
A home run hit, the game's momentum builds.
The shortstop turns, a double play,
The outfielders throw, a runner's way.
The game of baseball, a test of might,
A battle of wills, a clash of light.
The players give their all, they shine,
A national pastime, a pure joy divine.
