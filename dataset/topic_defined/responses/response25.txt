My love, you are the melody that fills my heart,
A symphony that never parts.
You are the rhythm that makes my soul take flight,
A beat that's strong and bright.

Your touch is like a ray of sunshine warm,
Enveloping me in your arms.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will sing and swing.
