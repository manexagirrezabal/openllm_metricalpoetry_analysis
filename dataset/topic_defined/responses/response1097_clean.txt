The game of baseball, a test of might,
A battle of skill, a clash of light.
The players face off, they give their all,
A home run, a strike out, the crowd's thrall.

The field is alive, with action all around,
A game of strategy, a test of sound.
The manager's decisions, the player's skill,
It's baseball, a sport to make your will.
