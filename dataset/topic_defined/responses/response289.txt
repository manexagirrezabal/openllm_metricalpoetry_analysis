Death, a passage that we all must take
A farewell to life's fleeting sake
Where dreams and hopes are laid to rest
And our souls embark on their eternal quest

In the end, it's not what we amass
Nor the fame or wealth we've amassed
But the love we shared, the memories we've made
That truly make life worth the shade
