My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
A brightness that never fades away.
You are the star that guides me through the night,
A beacon of hope and light.

Your touch is like a warm embrace, enfolding me,
A feeling that's pure and free.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will dance and sing.
