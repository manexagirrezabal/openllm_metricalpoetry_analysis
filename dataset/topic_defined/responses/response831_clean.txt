A cell, a tiny unit of life,
A world within itself, full of strife.
With membranes, organelles, and more,
It's a complex system, forever in store.

Inside the cell, a bustling crowd,
A flurry of activity, loud and proud.
The mitochondria, they generate heat,
The ribosomes, they build proteins to compete.
