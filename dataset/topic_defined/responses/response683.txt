A year, a journey, a path we take
Twelve months, each one a step we make
A chance to explore, to learn and grow
To leave the past behind, and reach for more

The days go by, some bright, some gray
Each one a gift, a new chance to play
The sun rises high, the moon glows keen
A year of dreams, of hopes yet unseen

The leaves fall off, the snow begins to lie
A season's rest, a time to ponder why
The world outside, a reflection of within
A year of growth, of love and forgiveness spin

So let us cherish this year with cheer
And make the most of every moment here
