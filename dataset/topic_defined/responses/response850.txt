A cell, so small and round,
A tiny world, profound.
Within its walls, a story's found,
Of life and growth, unbound.

Its membrane, a thin skin,
A barrier, a threshold to win.
Through pores, a passage in,
For nutrients, a gain.

Inside, a fluid, rich and bright,
A cytoplasm, a world of delight.
Organelles, like tiny stars,
Shining, playing their parts.

A nucleus, a central heart,
A control room, a work of art.
Chromosomes, a twisted pair,
A code, a secret to share.
