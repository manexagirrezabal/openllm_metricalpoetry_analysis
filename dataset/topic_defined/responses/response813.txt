A cell, so small, yet full of might
The building block of life, day and night
It grows, it divides, it thrives and dies
In endless cycles, never surprised

Its walls, a membrane thin and strong
Keep contents inside, where they belong
The cytoplasm, a soup of life
Where chemical reactions take their strife

The nucleus, a kernel of command
Holds genes, the blueprints of the land
It guides the cell, on its path to growth
Through mitosis, it never loses its oath
