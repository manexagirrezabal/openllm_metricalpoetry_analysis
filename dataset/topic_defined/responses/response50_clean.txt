My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a feeling that we all adore
It's the reason we live and explore
It's the smile on our face when we're with that special one
The joy in our heart when love has just begun

Love is a gift that we give and receive
It's the laughter and tears that we share and believe
It's the warmth in our soul when we're in each other's arms
The happiness that love brings, it's a treasure to charm
