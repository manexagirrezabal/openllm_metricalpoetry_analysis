The forest sways, a gentle dance
A symphony of life, a chance to prance
The trees, they stand, a towering height
A canopy of green, a world of might

The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight
A palette pure, a painter's delight
The bees and butterflies, they flit and play
In nature's rhythm, a dance so gay

The breeze whispers low, a gentle lull
The leaves, they rustle, a soothing pull
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green
A sanctuary, a place to alight and seen

In nature's heart, I find my home
A place of peace, a life of my own
