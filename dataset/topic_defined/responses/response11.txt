My love, you are the rose in my garden,
Soft petals, sweet scent, and a beauty to behold.
You are the sunshine that brightens my day,
Warming my heart and making it gold.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for you.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will be forever young.
