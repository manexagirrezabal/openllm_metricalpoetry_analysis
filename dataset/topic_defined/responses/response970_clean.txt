In the supermarket, oh so bright
Aisles upon aisles, a wondrous sight
Fresh produce, canned goods, and meat
A feast for the senses, a treat to eat

The carts are filled, the registers ring
As shoppers gather, their treasures to bring
Home cooked meals, snacks, and drinks galore
The supermarket's bounty, forever more

In the produce section, oh so green
Fruits and veggies, a healthy dream
Apples, bananas, carrots, and beans
Nature's finest, at our fingertips, it seems

The supermarket's magic, never fades
A place where hunger, is always sated
So let us shop, and cook with glee
In the supermarket, a wonderland for me.
