Death, the final frontier, a journey we all must take,
A passage to the unknown, a fate we cannot escape.
The end of life, a time to lay our burdens down,
And rest in peace, free from the weight of this world's frown.

The reaper's scythe, it cuts us down with ease,
A swift and silent end, a release from all disease.
Our bodies fade, our souls take flight,
To realms beyond this life, where all is made right.

In death, we find peace, a solace from the strife,
A place where pain and sorrow lose their sting and rife.
The grave, a home, where we'll rest until the end,
A sanctuary, where our spirits can descend.
