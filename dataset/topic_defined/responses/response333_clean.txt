Death, a darkness that descends upon us all
A final curtain call, a last and final stand
The end of life, a journey to the unknown
A passage through the veil, to the other side

In death, our stories are forever told
A tale of love and loss, of joy and cold
The memories we leave, a legacy to hold
A life lived, a journey to behold

But death, it also brings a peaceful rest
A release from pain, a time to be blessed
A quiet slumber, free from life's unrest
A place where suffering is no more

So let us cherish life, while we can
For death, it waits, like a patient man
It's a reminder, to live each day
To love and laugh, before we fade away.
