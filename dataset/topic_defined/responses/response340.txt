Death, a mystery we all must face
A journey to a distant place
Where our souls will find their grace

In the end, we'll all be gone
Our time on earth will soon be done
But memories live on and on

The final curtain call we'll take
Our bodies weak, our spirits break
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust we'll make

Eternal sleep we'll embrace
No pain, no fear, no time, no space
In death, we'll find our peaceful place
