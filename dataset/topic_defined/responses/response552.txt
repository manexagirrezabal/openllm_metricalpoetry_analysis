Attention, oh attention, a power we wield
A moment's notice, a story to unfold
We give it to those who deserve it best
A friend's laughter, a sunset's gentle rest

It's a spotlight that shines, a stage to perform
A chance to be seen, to let our light burn
In the world's chaos, it's a beacon we cling
A guiding force, a hope that makes us sing

Attention, oh attention, a gift we receive
A moment's love, a life we can believe
It's a treasure we earn, a blessing we share
A bond that grows, a love beyond compare.
