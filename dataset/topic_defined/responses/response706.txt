A year, a sweep of time so bright,
A cycle of seasons, a chance to ignite.
From budding dreams to harvest gold,
It's a journey that stories to unfold.

The months go by, each one a gleam,
A story of growth, a tale to redeem.
From frosty winter to summer's warmth,
It's a year of change, a chance to be reborn.
