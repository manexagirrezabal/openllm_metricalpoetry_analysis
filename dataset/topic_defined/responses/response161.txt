The forest sways, a sea of green
A canopy above, a shaded scene
The trees, they tower, a mighty throng
Their roots, they dig, a song so strong

The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight
A palette pure, a painter's delight
The bees and butterflies, they dance with glee
In nature's rhythm, wild and free

The breeze whispers low, a gentle lull
The leaves, they rustle, a soothing pull
The forest floor, a carpet soft
A sanctuary, a place to alight and oft

In nature's heart, I find my home
A place of peace, a life of my own
