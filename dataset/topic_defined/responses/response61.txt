My love, you are the missing piece I never knew I needed,
The one that makes my heart whole and complete.
You are the sunshine that brightens up my day,
And the stars that light up my night, so sweet.

Your touch is like a warm embrace,
A feeling that I can't replace.
It's like a gentle breeze on a summer day,
A feeling that never goes away.

Together we create a love so strong,
A bond that will last all lifetime long.
Through laughter and through tears, we'll face it all,
Together, our love will stand tall.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let go of the love we hold dear.
For with you by my side, my love, I know,
That our love will forever glow and grow.
