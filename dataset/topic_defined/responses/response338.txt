Death, a door that slowly creaks open
A passage to the unknown, a secret unspoken
Beyond the veil, a mystery unseen
A journey through the darkness, unclean

The weight of death, a heavy burden bears
A grief so deep, it leaves us torn and scarred
The loss of love, a void that cannot be filled
A sorrow that our hearts cannot be built

But in death, there's also hope to find
A promise of renewal, a new life designed
A chance to rest, from life's weary strife
A peaceful slumber, free from pain and life

So let us embrace life, while we can
For death, it lurks, like a silent panther in the land
It's a reminder, to cherish each day
To love and laugh, before we fade away.
