Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, life can change its course,
A new direction, a different force.
What was once a dream can now come true,
A possibility realized, that's new.

An instance can be a time to act,
A prompt to seize the moment's fact.
It's a chance to make a difference, to take a stand,
To write a new chapter in the land.

In an instant, we can find our voice,
A message clear, a choice to rejoice.
It's a time to let go of fear and doubt,
And embrace the moment, without a rout.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
An opportunity to be free.
To dance with change, to sing a new song,
To live each moment, all day long.
