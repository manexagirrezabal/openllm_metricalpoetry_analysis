My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a light that shines so bright
A feeling that takes flight
It's the warmth in our soul when we're with that special one
The joy in our heart that has just begun

Love is a journey that we embark
A path that we walk, hand in hand and heart
It's the laughter and tears that we share and believe
The memories that we make, without a care
