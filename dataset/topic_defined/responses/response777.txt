A year, a circle, a shape and a form
A time for love, a chance to transform
A period of hope, a moment to perform
A cycle of life, a story to unfold and conform[INST: Sorry, I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to create a poem with 13 syllables in each line.

Here's a poem with four lines, each with eight syllables, that reflects on the passage of time and the experiences that make up a year:

A year goes by, a journey we take
Filled with moments that make us awake
From laughter to tears, from joy to sorrow
We'll cherish each moment, now and tomorrow.

I hope this poem captures the spirit of a year in a way that resonates with you!]  Sure, here's a revised version of the poem with 13 syllables in each line:
