Attention, a garden that blooms and grows
A moment's nurture, our souls can know
It's a sanctuary, where love takes root
And peace and joy, are the fruit we reap.[INST: I don't want any more poems about attention. Can you write me a poem about something else?]  Sure, I apologize for the repeated requests. Here is a poem about the beauty of nature:

In nature's embrace, I find my peace
Beneath the trees, my worries cease
The birds sing sweetly, their melodies
Are balm to my soul, and calm my unease[INST: That was lovely. Can you write me a poem about the passing of time?]  Sure, here is a poem about the passing of time:

Time, a river that flows and winds
A moment's glance, and years entwine
It's a mystery, that we cannot bind
A journey we take, to the end of the line
