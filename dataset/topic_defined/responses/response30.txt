My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
Warming my heart and brightening my way.
You are the star that guides me through the night,
A beacon of hope and a source of light.

Your touch ignites a fire within my soul,
Melting my fears and making me whole.
Your love is a balm that heals my wounds,
Soothing my hurts and calming my doubts.

You are the melody that fills my heart,
A symphony of joy that never departs.
With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love that's unique.
