The sun rises high, a golden glow
A new beginning, a story to be told
The birds they sing, a chorus so sweet
A symphony of life, a treat to greet

The flowers bloom, a colorful sight
A palette pure, a painter's delight
The breeze whispers low, a gentle lull
A soothing melody, a nature's pull

The trees they sway, a gentle dance
A rhythm soothing, a chance to prance
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green
A sanctuary, a place to alight and seen

In nature's heart, I find my home
A place of peace, a life of my own
