Fresh as the morning dew
Fragrant as the scent of flowers
Aisles of plenty, shelves of wonders

Colors dance, a rainbow's hue
Fruits and veggies, a healthy view
Nature's bounty, all for you

Meats and seafood, a savory treat
Butcher's corner, a cut above the street
Dairy products, a creamy delight

Checkout lines, a final goodbye
Cashiers smile, a friendly reply
Carrots and bananas, a healthy sigh
