The supermarket, a bustling scene,
A place where needs and wants are seen.
Fresh fruits and veggies, a colorful display,
Bread and pastries, a delicious way.

Meats and cheeses, a savory delight,
Canned goods and snacks, a satisfying bite.
Drinks and juices, a refreshing treat,
A world of flavors, at your feet.

The aisles stretch out, a maze to navigate,
Shelves stacked high, a treasure to cultivate.
Shopping carts and baskets, at the ready,
A place where dreams and lists are made steady.
