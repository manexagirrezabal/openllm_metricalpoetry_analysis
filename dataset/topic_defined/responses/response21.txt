My love, you are the rhythm of my heart,
Beating in time with every part.
You are the melody that fills my mind,
A symphony of love that's all the time.

Your smile is like a ray of sunshine bright,
Illuminating my world and making it right.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will sing and swing.
