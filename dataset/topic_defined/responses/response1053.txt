In the summer sun, they play the game,
With gloves and bats, they take the field.
The pitcher throws, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the crowd erupts in cheers.
The shortstop makes a play, the outfielders too,
A double play, the game is anew.
The final out, the game is won,
The players celebrate, the crowd is gone.
