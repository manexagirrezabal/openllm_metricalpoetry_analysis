My love, you are the missing piece that makes me whole,
The one that brings my heart and soul to goal.
You are the light that shines in every darkest place,
The hope that gives me strength to face each day with grace.

Your touch is like a warm embrace on a cold winter's night,
A feeling that chases all my fears and doubts away from sight.
It's like a gentle rain that falls upon my heart,
A love that nourishes and never parts.

Together we create a love that's pure and true,
A bond that will forever be strong and new.
Through laughter and through tears, we'll face it all,
Together, our love will stand tall.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let go of the love we hold dear.
For with you by my side, my love, I know,
That our love will forever glow and grow.
