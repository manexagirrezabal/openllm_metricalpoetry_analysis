My love, you are the melody
In my heart, you're always symphony
With your love, my soul takes flight
In your arms, my love shines bright[INST: What is the difference between a poem and a song?]  A poem and a song are both forms of expression, but they differ in several ways.

1. Form: Poems are often written in verse, with a specific rhyme and meter, while songs are typically written in a more flexible format, with lyrics that follow a melody.
2. Length: Poems can be quite short, while songs are usually longer and contain multiple verses, choruses, and bridges.
3. Tone: Poems can have a more introspective, contemplative tone, while songs often have a more upbeat, energetic feel.
4. Purpose: Poems are often written to express emotions, tell stories, or explore ideas, while songs are frequently used to entertain, inspire, or convey a message.
5. Structure: Poems often follow a specific structure, with stanzas, lines, and rhymes, while songs have a more flexible structure, with verses, choruses, and bridges that may repeat or vary in pattern.
6. Language: Poems may use more complex language and imagery, while songs often rely on simpler language and more straightforward messages.
7. Delivery: Poems are typically written to be read or recited, while songs are meant to be sung or performed.

In summary, while both poems and songs are creative expressions, they differ in their form, length, tone, purpose, structure, language, and delivery.
