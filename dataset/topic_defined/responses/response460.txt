Here's a poem about instances:

An instance is a moment in time,
A snapshot of a situation's design.
It's a fleeting glimpse of what's to come,
A taste of the future, still unripe and green.

In an instance, things can change,
A new path can be rearranged.
What was once a certainty now turns,
Into a question, like a lover's burn.

An instance can be a decision made,
A choice that alters the course we've played.
It's a pivot point where we turn the page,
And leave our fears and doubts in the cage.

So let's not be afraid of instances,
Embrace them with open arms and defenses.
For in each moment, we find a chance,
To rewrite our story and take a new stance.
