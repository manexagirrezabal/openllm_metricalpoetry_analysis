The supermarket's shelves, they stretch so high
A treasure trove, for the eye to fly
Canned goods and snacks, in rows so fine
A feast for senses, a delightful dine

The shoppers' carts, they fill with glee
A bounty of goods, for all to see
From fresh produce, to meats so prime
A supermarket's treasures, all intertwine

In the produce section, oh so bright
Nature's finest, a wondrous sight
Juicy fruits, crunchy veggies too
Freshness abounds, in all they do

The supermarket's magic, never fades
A place where hunger, is always sated
So let us shop, and cook with cheer
In the supermarket, a wonderland so dear.
