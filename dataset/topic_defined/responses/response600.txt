Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and rare
A moment's notice, a glance, an instant of care
But then it's gone, lost in the air

The world spins on, its chaos reigns
Our minds wander, our thoughts stray
Attention's a prize, hard to gain

In this noise, this constant din
We struggle to focus, to win
A moment's peace, a chance to begin

But still we seek, we yearn and crave
That elusive thing, that moment of grace
When attention's paid, when we're not ignored, but loved.
