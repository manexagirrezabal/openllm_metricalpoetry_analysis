The crack of the bat, the cheer of the crowd
A home run hit, and the game is loud
The player rounds the bases, a grin on his face
A victory dance, the game's pace

The pitcher winds up, the batter swings
A hit, a run, the game's wings
The shortstop makes a play, the outfielders too
A double play, the game is anew

The umpire calls the strikes, the catcher throws
The bases are loaded, the game is in tow
A steal, a slide, a cloud of dust
A run scores, the game is a must

In the bleachers, fans cheer and shout
Their team's ahead, they're on a rollout
Hot dogs and popcorn, peanuts too
The snacks are abundant, the game's anew
