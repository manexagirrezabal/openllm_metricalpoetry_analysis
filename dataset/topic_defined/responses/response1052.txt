In the summer sun, they play the game,
With gloves and bats, they take the field.
The pitcher throws, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the crowd erupts in cheers.
The shortstop makes a play, the outfielders too,
A double play, the game is anew.
The final out, the game is won.[INST: Can you make it a little more interesting?]  Sure, here's a revised version with a few tweaks to make it more interesting:

The sun shines bright, the grass is green,
A battle of skills, a game of dreams.
The pitcher winds up, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the crowd sings.
The shortstop makes a play, the outfielders too,
A double play, the game is new.
The final out, the game is won,
The players celebrate, the crowd is gone.
