My love, you are the rhythm that makes my heart sing,
The melody that brings joy to everything.
You are the words that fill my soul with cheer,
The poetry that brings me closer, my dear.

Your touch is like a gentle river flowing,
A feeling that never stops glowing.
It's like a warm and cozy fireplace,
A love that fills my heart with grace.

Together we create a symphony of love,
A song that will forever be sung from above.
Through laughter and through tears, we'll face it all,
Together, our love will stand tall.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let go of the love we hold dear.
For with you by my side, my love, I know,
That our love will forever glow and grow.
