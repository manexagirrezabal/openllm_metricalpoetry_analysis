A cell, a tiny, fragile thing,
Yet holds the power to make life sing.
Within its walls, a symphony,
Weaves life and death, in harmony.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 2 stanzas about cell?]  Sure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about cell:

A cell, a tiny, fragile thing,
Yet holds the power to make life sing.
Within its walls, a symphony,
Weaves life and death, in harmony.

Its walls, a sanctuary, strong and true,
Keep secrets hidden, stories anew.
A cell, a small, yet mighty thing,
Where life and death, in silence, sing.
