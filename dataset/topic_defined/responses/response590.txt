Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and rare
A moment's notice, a glance, and then it's gone
The world spins on, its chaos, its fray
Leaving us craving, yearning for more

In the stillness, we search for a face
A connection, a touch, a gentle embrace
But attention's a thief, it steals and runs
Leaving us chasing, grasping for crumbs

We try to grab it, to hold it tight
To keep it close, to make it stay the night
But attention's a slippery thing
It slides away, leaving us wrung

So we cry out, we plead and we beg
For just a moment, a fragment of leg
Of attention's time, of its fleeting grace
To feel seen, heard, to find our place.
