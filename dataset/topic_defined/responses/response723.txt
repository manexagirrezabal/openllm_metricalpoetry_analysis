A year, a span of time so bright,
A journey through the seasons' light.
From spring's awakening to summer's glow,
To autumn's harvest and winter's snow.

The months, they pass, each one a breeze,
A story told, a memory to seize.
From new beginnings to cherished ends,
A year, a tale, and all that transpires.

The days, they dawn, they dusk, they shine,
A canvas painted, a life divine.
With laughter, tears, and moments shared,
A year, a treasure, forever spared.

The hours, they tick, they tock, they chime,
A symphony of life's rhyme.
A dance of seconds, a beat of time,
A year, a melody, sublime.
