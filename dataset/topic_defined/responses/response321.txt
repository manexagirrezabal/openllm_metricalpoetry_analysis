Death, a transition we all must make
A passage to the other side, we'll take
Our souls ascend, leaving bodies behind
A journey to the unknown, we'll find

The grave, a resting place for the dead
A sanctuary where memories are fed
Their stories lived, their legacies shared
In our hearts, their spirits are bared

Eternal sleep, a peaceful reprieve
A slumber free from pain and grief
No fears, no sorrows, no more strife
Just rest, a release from life's strive

But though we lay beneath the ground
Our love and memories still resound
In those who come after us, they'll find
Death's not end, but a new design.
