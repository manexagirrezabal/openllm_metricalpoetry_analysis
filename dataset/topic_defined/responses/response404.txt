Instance, a moment in time,
A chance to make a difference, sublime.
A spark of action, a flash of thought,
Can change the course of life, as sought.
In this brief moment, we hold the key,
To unlock our potential, wild and free.
For in this instant, we are alive,
And our choices shape the world we thrive.
