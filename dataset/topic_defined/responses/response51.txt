My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a flame that burns bright and true
A feeling that's pure, and sweet, and new
It's the whispered words in the dead of night
The touch that ignites a spark of delight

Love is a journey that we embark
A path that we walk, hand in hand and heart
It's the laughter and tears that we share
The memories that we make, without a care
