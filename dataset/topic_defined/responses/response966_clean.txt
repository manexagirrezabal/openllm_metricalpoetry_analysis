In the supermarket, a world of wonder
Aisles of treasures, to ponder
Fresh fruits and veggies, a colorful sight
A symphony of flavors, a culinary delight

The shelves are stacked, the choices many
A gourmet's paradise, for young and any
Bread, meats, cheeses, oh so fine
A feast for the senses, all intertwined.
