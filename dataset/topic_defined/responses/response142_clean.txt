The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks a challenge, a adventure's might.
The valleys below, a lush embrace,
A home for creatures, a place of grace.
The wind whispers through, a gentle breeze,
Nature's melody, a symphony that teases.
The flowers bloom, their colors bright,
A tapestry woven, a beauty in sight.
