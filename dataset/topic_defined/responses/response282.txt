Death, a silence that we all must keep
A secret that we'll never sleep
Where lives and loves are but a sigh
And our stories fade into the sky

In the end, it's not what we achieve
Nor the battles we've fought and believed
But the love we shared, the laughter we've known
That truly makes life worth being shown
