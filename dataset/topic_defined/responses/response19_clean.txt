My love, you are the sun that shines so bright,
Warming my heart and making everything right.
You are the clouds that float by,
A love that's unbreakable, never shy.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for you.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
