Attention, oh attention, a treasure to find
A moment's notice, a glance, and then it's mine
We seek it out, we chase it with fire
But it eludes us, like a fleeting desire

It's a curious thing, this attention we need
A validation of self, a nod, a deed
We'll do anything, say anything, just to get
A moment in the sun, a chance to be set.
