Sure, here's a short poem about baseball:

The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A ball soaring through the sky, a treat to meet,
The roar of the crowd, a joyful beat.

The grassy field, a vibrant green,
Players clad in white, a pristine scene,
Bases loaded, the game's keen.

The pitcher winds up, a moment tense,
The batter swings, a shot immense,
A home run, the crowd erupts in sense.

The umpire calls, a voice so clear,
The players hustle, no time to fear,
Baseball's magic, pure and dear.
