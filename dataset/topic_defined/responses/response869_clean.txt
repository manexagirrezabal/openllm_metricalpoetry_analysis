A cell, a tiny droplet of life,
A universe within, full of strife and might.
Its walls, a fragile shell, a protective barrier in life's fight.

The nucleus, a central fire,
A spark of creation, a burning desire.
The DNA, a blueprint, a code to aspire.

Mitochondria, like tiny factories,
Energy they produce, in abundance and wondrous deeds.
Fueling life, their work never falters or snoozes.

Ribosomes, the protein makers,
Building blocks of life, no room for errors or flakes.
Their work, a never-ending rhyme, a symphony of life's constructs.
