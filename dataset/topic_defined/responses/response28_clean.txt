My love, you are the rhythm of my heart,
A beat that never falls apart.
You are the melody that fills my mind,
A symphony of love that's divine.

Your touch is like a gentle summer breeze,
Soothing my soul with ease.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will sing and swing.
