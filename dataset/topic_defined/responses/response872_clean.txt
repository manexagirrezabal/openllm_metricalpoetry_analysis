A small, sleek device, yet powerful too,
My cell, a tool, a friend, a clue.
With just a touch, a swipe, a tap,
I'm linked to all, my knowledge to map.

Through its screen, a window to the world,
I see the sights, I hear the word.
From dawn till dusk, it never sleeps,
My cell, a watchdog, vigilant, it keeps.

In times of need, it stands by me,
A beacon bright, a guiding light to see.
With apps galore, it's always ready,
My cell, a loyal friend, a steadfast ally.
