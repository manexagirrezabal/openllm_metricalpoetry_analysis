Sure, here's another poem about instances:

In the digital realm, they bloom and fade,
A moment's thought, a digital shade,
Instance, a moment's parade.

With servers humming, code unfurls,
A fleeting dream, a digital whirl,
Instance, a moment's twirls.

A burst of compute, a flash of light,
A moment's glory, a digital sight,
Instance, a moment's might.

In the virtual world, they come and go,
Ephemeral, like snow in the flow,
Instance, a moment's glow.
