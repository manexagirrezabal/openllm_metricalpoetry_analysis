Attention, oh attention, a prize to behold
A moment's notice, a glance, and then it's told
We quest for it, we seek it with might
But it slips away, like a fleeting sight

It's a curious thing, this attention we crave
A validation of worth, a moment to be brave
We'll do anything, say anything, just to get
A slice of the spotlight, a chance to be met.
