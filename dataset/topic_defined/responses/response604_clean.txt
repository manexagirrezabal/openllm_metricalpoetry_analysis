Attention, oh attention, a treasure so fine
A moment's notice, a glance, a sign of design
In this world of noise, it's hard to align

Our minds are busy, our thoughts astray
Attention's a prize, hard to stay
But we yearn for it, day by day

The world spins on, its chaos reigns
We struggle to focus, to gain
A moment's peace, a chance to sustain

But still we seek, we yearn and crave
That elusive thing, that moment of grace
When attention's paid, when we're not ignored, but loved.
