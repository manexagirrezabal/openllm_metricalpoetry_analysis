Instance, a moment of change,
A time of transformation, a new range.
A chance to break free, a time to move,
From the past, to a brighter groove.
In this brief moment, we find our strength,
A will to overcome, a fresh length.
For in this instant, we are alive,
And our future, it thrives and survives.
