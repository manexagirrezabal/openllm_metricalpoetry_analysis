Death, a mystery we all must face
A journey to the unknown place
Where our souls will find their rest
And our bodies will be blessed

The time will come, it's fate's decree
When our lives will cease to be
Our hearts will stop, our breath will still
And death's icy chill will fill

But fear not, for death is not the end
For in its wake, a new life will begin
A life of peace, of love, of light
Where sorrow, pain and fear take flight

So let us embrace this final step
And find solace in eternal sleep
