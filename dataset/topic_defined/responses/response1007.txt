Asupermarket so vast and grand
Where culinary dreams take flight

Aisles of wonder, rows of delight
Fresh produce beckons, morning light
Bread and pasta, a culinary dream
Satisfying snacks, a symphony to gleam

Shelves of treasure, a cornucopia to explore
Canned and boxed, a feast for four
Drinks and sweets, a taste sensation
A supermarket experience, pure elation

Fragrant flowers, colorful display
Meats and seafood, a savory way
Specialty cheeses, a gourmet's delight
Satisfying shopping, day or night

Supermarket aisles, a world of delight
A culinary adventure, morning to night

Where every visit, a new delight
A supermarket, a feast for the sight

And in the checkout line, a final treat
A chance to savor, a moment to greet

The cashier's smile, a friendly beat
A supermarket visit, a joyful treat

A place where needs are met with ease
A supermarket, a place to please

Where shopping is a pleasure, not a chore
A supermarket, a place to explore.[INST: Please write me a poem with 3 stanzas with 4 lines each and a last one with 2 lines about supermarket]  Sure, here's a poem about a supermarket with 3 stanzas with 4 lines each and a final stanza with 2 lines:
