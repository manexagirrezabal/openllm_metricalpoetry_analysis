The year begins, a blank page unfurls,
A fresh start beckons, a story to unfurled.
The months go by, each one a new chapter,
A tale of triumphs, a saga to remember.
The days fly past, some slow, some fast,
But every moment is a chance to last.
A year, a journey, a path we tread,
A story woven, a life well-led.
