A cell, so small and round,
A tiny world, profound.
Within its walls, a story's found.

A nucleus, a central heart,
Beats life into every part.
The cytoplasm, a sea to chart.

Mitochondria, like powerhouses,
Energy they generate and devise.
A cell's fuel, they never pause.

Ribosomes, the protein makers,
Create life's building blocks, no fakers.
Their work, a never-ending task.
