Love is a feeling that's hard to define,
It's a force that's always on my mind and divine.
With you, my heart beats faster,
My love for you will never be disaster.

Your eyes are the stars that light up my night,
They show me the beauty that's out of sight and bright.
In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
My love for you will forever embrace.

You are the rhythm that makes my heart sing,
The one that makes my love from the start and ring.
With every kiss and touch, my love for you grows,
Together, our love will forever glows.

Love is a journey we'll take with grace,
Hand in hand, we'll face life's ups and downs with pace and grace.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
My love for you will forever be won.
