A cell, a microcosm of life,
A world within a world, full of strife and might.
Its walls, a barrier, thin and tight.

The nucleus, a central sun,
A source of light, life's beginnings have begun.
The DNA, a code, forever spun.

Mitochondria, like tiny factories,
Energy they produce, in abundance and wondrous deeds.
Fueling life, their work never snoozes or slows.

Ribosomes, the protein makers,
Building blocks of life, no room for errors or flakes.
Their work, a never-ending rhyme, a symphony of life's constructs.
