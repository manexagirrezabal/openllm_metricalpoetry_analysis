Death, a journey that we all must take
A path that we cannot mistake
Where memories and dreams are laid to rest
And our souls embark on their eternal quest

In the end, it's not what we possess
Nor the fame or wealth we've amassed
But the love we shared, the joy we've known
That truly makes life worth being shown
