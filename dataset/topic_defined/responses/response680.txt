A year, a cycle, a measure of time
Twelve months, seasons that rhyme
A chance to start anew, to begin again
To leave the past behind, and move on from pain

The days go by, some long, some short
Each one a gift, a new chance to report
The sun rises high, the moon glows bright
A year of hopes, of dreams taking flight

The leaves fall off, the snow begins to pile
A season's rest, a time to reconcile
The world outside, a reflection of within
A year of growth, of love and forgiveness spin

So let us embrace this year with cheer
And make the most of every moment here
