A tiny prison, bars of steel,
A cell that holds, a soul that's real.
A place of solitude, a space to think,
A room that's small, yet feels like a shrink.

The walls are bare, the floor is cold,
The only comfort, a thin, hard fold.
A bed that's narrow, a blanket that's worn,
A cell that's harsh, where freedom's scorned.
