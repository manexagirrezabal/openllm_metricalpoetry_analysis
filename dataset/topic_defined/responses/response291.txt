Death, a mystery, a fate we all must face,
A journey to the unknown, a path we must embrace.
The end of life, a time to let go of our fears,
And find solace in the peace that death brings near.

The reaper's scythe, it cuts us down with grace,
A gentle passage to the other side, a place of rest and space.
Our bodies fade, our souls take flight,
To realms beyond this life, where all is made right.

In death, we find release, a freedom from our pain,
A place where sorrow loses its sting and becomes plain.
The grave, a home, where we'll rest until the end,
A sanctuary, where our spirits can descend.
