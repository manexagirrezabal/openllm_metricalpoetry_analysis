My love, you are the melody,
That fills my heart with harmony.
In your eyes, I see the truth,
A love that's pure and sweet and new.

Your touch is the warm embrace,
That chases all my fears away.
With you, my heart finds its place,
And love's sweet song it plays.

Together we create a love,
That's strong and true and full of grace.
A bond that can never be broken,
A love that will forever find its way.

And in the end, love is the key,
The answer to all life's mystery.
For with you, my love, I know,
That our love will forever grow.
