My love, you are the stars that shine so bright,
A celestial love that's out of sight.
You are the moon that glows with grace,
A love that's unbreakable, in its place.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for you.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
