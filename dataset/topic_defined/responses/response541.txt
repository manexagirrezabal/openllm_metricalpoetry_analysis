Attention, oh attention, a gift we impart
With every glance, every nod, every heart
We give it freely, or so it would seem
But often it's scarce, a rare gem to glean

It's a curious thing, this attention we crave
A validation of worth, a moment to be brave
We'll do anything, say anything, just to get
A slice of the spotlight, a chance to be met.
