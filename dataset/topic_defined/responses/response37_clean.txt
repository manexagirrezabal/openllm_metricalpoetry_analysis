My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
Warming my heart and brightening my way.
You are the star that guides me through the night,
A beacon of hope and a source of light.

Your touch ignites a fire within my soul,
Melting my fears and making me whole.
With you, my love, I feel complete,
Together we create a love that's unique.

You are the melody that fills my heart,
A symphony of joy that never departs.
In your eyes, my soul finds a home,
With you, my love, I am never alone.

You are the missing piece that makes me whole,
The one that brings my heart to its goal.
Together we create a love that's pure,
A bond that's strong and forever sure.

You are the sunshine in my sky,
The star that guides me, and I know why.
With you, my love, my heart takes flight,
Soaring high and feeling light as a kite.
