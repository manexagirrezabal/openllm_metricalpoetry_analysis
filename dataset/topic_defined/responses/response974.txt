The supermarket's aisles, they stretch so far
A world of wonders, beyond compare
Fresh bread and pastries, oh so sweet
A feast for senses, a treat to eat

The shoppers' carts, they fill with delight
A bounty of goods, a wondrous sight
From canned delights, to meats so fine
A supermarket's treasures, all intertwine

In the produce section, oh so bright
Nature's finest, a wondrous sight
Juicy berries, crunchy apples too
Freshness abounds, in all they do

The supermarket's magic, never fades
A place where hunger, is always sated
So let us shop, and cook with cheer
In the supermarket, a wonderland so dear.
