Sure, here's another poem about instances:

In the digital expanse, they shine so bright,
A moment's thought, a digital delight,
Instance, a moment's light.

With code unfolding, dreams take flight,
A fleeting vision, a digital sight,
Instance, a moment's might.

A burst of compute, a flash of power,
A moment's glory, an hour,
Instance, a moment's flower.

In the virtual world, they live and die,
Ephemeral, like clouds in the sky,
Instance, a moment's sigh.
