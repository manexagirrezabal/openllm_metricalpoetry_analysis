Love is a feeling so divine,
It makes my heart sing and shine.
With every kiss and tender touch,
My love for you will never clash.

Your eyes are like the morning dew,
So bright and fresh, they light up my view.
In your arms, I feel so safe and sound,
My love for you will forever be bound.

You make my world a brighter place,
With every smile and every grace.
I'm lost in your beauty and your charm,
My love for you will never disarm.

Love is a journey we embark,
Together hand in hand, we'll travel far.
Through joys and sorrows, we'll face it all,
My love for you will forever stand tall.
