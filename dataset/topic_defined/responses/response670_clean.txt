A year, a span of time so bright,
A cycle of seasons, a rhythm in sight.
Twelve months, each one a unique delight,
A journey of growth, a chance to ignite.
The days go by, some long, some short and sweet,
But every one a treasure, a moment to seize.
A year, a gift, a chance to start anew,
A time to reflect, a moment to renew.
