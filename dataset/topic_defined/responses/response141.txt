The sun sets slow, the sky ablaze,
With colors vibrant, a picturesque daze.
The trees sway soft, their leaves a golden hue,
A peaceful scene, both calm and true.
Nature's symphony, a gentle sound,
A lullaby, without a single bound.
The stars appear, like diamonds bright,
A night of rest, a pure delight.
