A current that carries us wild and carefree.
With every wave, our love will rise,
Together, our love will reach the skies.[INST: ]  Sure, here is a poem with 1 stanza about love:

Love is a bridge that connects our hearts,
A bond that strengthens and never parts.
With every step, our love will grow,
Together, our love will forever glow
