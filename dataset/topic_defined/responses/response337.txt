Death, a shadow that follows us all
A silent companion, never to fall
It lingers near, a constant guest
In the background, always present

The grim reaper, a figure so dire
Cuts down our lives, like a scythe on fire
No escape, no reprieve, it's fate's call
Our time on earth, a fleeting squall

But in death, there's also peace to find
A release from pain, and suffering unwind
A rest from life's weary load
A quiet slumber, in a dark abode

So let us cherish life, while we can
For death, it waits, with an outstretched hand
It's a reminder, to live each day
To love and laugh, before we pay.
