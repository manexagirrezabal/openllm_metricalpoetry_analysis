In the hustle and bustle of life's race,
I often lost my way, time and space,
But then, in an instant, I found my place,
A moment of peace, a quiet embrace.

In that instant's heart, I discovered,
A brand new start, a fresh beginning,
A chance to let go of the past,
And seize the day, to make it last.

And so, I embraced the instance's grace,
And found my path, a new, bright space,
Where I could be myself, free and true,
A moment of clarity, pure and new.
