The ocean waves, a symphony of sound
A rhythm soothing, a melody all around
The tides, they rise and fall
A dance of life, a story to enthrall

The sea creatures, a diverse band
A world of wonder, a treasure to expand
The coral reefs, a colorful sight
A world within a world, a beauty so bright

The beach, a place of peace and calm
A haven for rest, a moment to disarm
The sand, it shifts, a changing shape
A reminder of life's fleeting escape

In nature's embrace, I find my home
A place of solace, a life of my own
