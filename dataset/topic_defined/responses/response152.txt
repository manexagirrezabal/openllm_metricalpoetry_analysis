The mountains rise, a majestic sight,
Their peaks hidden, in the light.
The snow falls soft, a gentle touch,
A blanket of white, so pure and such.
The trees stand tall, their branches bare,
A winter landscape, so fair and rare.
The silence is broken, by a bird's song,
A melody that lasts, all day long.
