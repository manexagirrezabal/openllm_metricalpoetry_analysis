My love, you are the sun that shines so bright,
Illuminating my world and making it light.
You are the river that flows through my heart,
A never-ending stream of love from the start.

Your touch is like a warm embrace, enfolding me,
A feeling that's pure and free.
With you, my love, I know I can face anything,
Together our love will dance and sing.
