Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and rare
A moment's notice, a glance, and then it's gone
We seek it out, we crave it so dear
But it slips through our fingers, like sand in the sea

It's a currency, a prize to be won
A treasure we trade, for a moment of fun
But oh, how it slips away, like the sun
Leaving us shadowed, and lonely, and done

Attention, oh attention, a wily thing
It flits and it flies, on wings of a king
It's a butterfly, a rainbow in flight
A whisper of beauty, a flash of light.
