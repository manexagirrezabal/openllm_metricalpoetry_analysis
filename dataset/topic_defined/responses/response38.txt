My love, you are the missing piece I never knew,
The one that makes my heart whole and true.
You are the bridge that spans the distance,
Connecting me to happiness and persistence.

Your love is a garden that blooms forever,
A haven of beauty and a source of forever.
With you, my soul takes flight,
Soaring high and feeling light.

You are the calm in every storm,
The shelter from life's rain and norm.
In your eyes, my future is clear,
With you, my love, I have nothing to fear.

Together we create a love that's pure,
A bond that's strong and forever sure.
You are the sunshine in my sky,
The star that guides me, and I know why.

With you, my love, my heart takes flight,
Soaring high and feeling light as a kite.
You are the missing piece that makes me whole,
The one that brings my heart to its goal.
