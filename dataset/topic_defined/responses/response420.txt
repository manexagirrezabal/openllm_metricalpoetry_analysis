Here's a poem about instances:

An instance, oh so brief,
A moment in time, a glimpse of belief.
A snapshot in the mind, a fleeting thought,
A flash of insight, brought to naught.
The instance passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A spark of hope, a glimmer of light.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
