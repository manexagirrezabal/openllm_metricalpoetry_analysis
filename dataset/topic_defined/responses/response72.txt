Love is a magic that's hard to explain,
It makes my heart sing and my soul maintain.
With you by my side, everything's alright,
My love for you will shine like the morning light.

Your smile is the sunshine in my day,
It chases away all my fears and dismay.
In your arms, I find my safe haven,
My love for you will forever be heaven.

You are the missing piece that makes me whole,
The one that brings my heart and soul control.
With every kiss and touch, my love for you grows,
Together, our love will forever glow.

Love is a journey we'll take with grace,
Hand in hand, we'll face life's ups and downs with pace.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
My love for you will forever be won.
