Bases loaded, two outs to go,
The crowd is on their feet, you know.
A swing of the bat, a hit so sweet,
The runner rounds third, he's got the beat.
The outfielders give chase, they're in a race,
But the runner slides safe, it's a beautiful sight.
The umpire calls him out, but he's not convinced,
He signals safe, the crowd is relieved.
The manager argues, he's got some nerve,
But the call stands, it's what the game deserves.
A pitching duel, a battle of wills,
The fans are on edge, they're in for thrills.
The score is tied, the tension mounts,
It's a baseball game that's full of counts.
