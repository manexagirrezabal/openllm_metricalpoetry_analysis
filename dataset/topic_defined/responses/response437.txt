Sure, here's another short poem about an instance:

A split second, a moment of time,
An instance of wonder, so divine.
A glimpse of magic, in the air,
A fleeting instant, beyond compare.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 2 stanzas?]  Sure, here's a short poem with 2 stanzas about an instance:

In the blink of an eye, it's gone,
A moment lived, a memory strong.
The instance passes, but its trace,
Lingers on, a lingering grace.

A snap of time, a flicker bright,
An instant captured in the light.
A moment of clarity, brought to sight,
A fleeting glimpse, but one that's tight.
