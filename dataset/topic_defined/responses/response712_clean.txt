A year, a span of time so bright,
A cycle of seasons, a rhythm in sight.
From budding flowers to falling leaves,
It's a journey that we all believe.

The spring, oh so full of hope,
A time for new beginnings, a chance to cope.
The summer, warm and long and bright,
A season of joy, a time to take flight.

The autumn, with colors ablaze,
A harvest of fruit, a time to amaze.
The winter, cold and crisp and clean,
A time for rest, a time serene.

A year, a gift so pure and true,
A journey of growth, a path anew.
It's a cycle that we all must face,
A year, a treasure, a time to embrace.
