Of course! Here is a poem for you:

In the mountains high, so rugged and steep,
The air is crisp, the views so deep.
The snow falls soft, in gentle touch,
As nature's beauty leaves us in awe.

In the ocean blue, where waves roll in,
The sea creatures play, in a world within.
Their cries echo, as they dance with glee,
As nature's music fills the sea.

In the desert sand, so hot and bright,
The sun shines down, with all its might.
The cacti stand, with spines so sharp,
As nature's beauty leaves us in awe.
