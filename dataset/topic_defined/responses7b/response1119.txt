Of course! Here is a poem about baseball with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

The game of baseball, a summer delight
With players giving their all in the fight
For victory, for pride, for sheer joy and light
In this game of skill that shines so bright and free tonight

The ball flies through the air with graceful ease
As the players show off their skillful breeze
The crowd cheers on with gleeful delight
In this game of magic and endless flight

The pitcher's spin, a wicked delight
As he throws with all his might and sight
The catcher's glove, a barrier in sight
And the runner's feet, they take flight with all their might tonight

The field's fresh cut grass, a sight so green
Where heroes are born and legends be seen
Baseball's magic lasts for you and me to be seen
In this game of skill that shines bright and free.
