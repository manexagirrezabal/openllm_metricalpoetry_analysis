Love is a fire that burns deep within,
A flame that flickers, but never dims.
It's the warmth that fills our hearts and souls,
A feeling that makes our spirits whole.

With love, we soar on wings of dreams,
Our hearts take flight, our spirits beams.
In its embrace, we find our home,
Where we belong, forever known.

Love is a gift from above,
A treasure to cherish and love.
It brings us joy and sets us free,
A feeling that's truly divine to see.

In love's gentle caress, we find peace,
A sense of calm, a world to cease.
With every beat of its sweet embrace,
We know we are in the right place.
