Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 4 lines, about love:

Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and souls in delight.
It's a feeling that takes flight,
Bringing joy to our lives tonight.

Love is a gentle breeze,
Soothing hearts with ease.
It's a gift that we all need,
A treasure that we can't exceed.

Love is a smile so wide,
Spreading cheer and pride.
It's a feeling that never fades,
A bond that forever shades.

Love is a heart that beats,
Pounding with sweet retreats.
It's a gift that we all share,
A treasure beyond compare.
