The year unfolds like a canvas bright,
A blank slate, waiting for life's art to take flight.
New beginnings, fresh starts, and endless possibility,
As each day brings new chances to be free.

With every moment, we make our mark,
Leaving behind a legacy that will forever embark.
The year may bring us joy or strife,
But with each step, we make the most of life
