Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines about nature:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that touches high.
The stars appear one by one at night,
A celestial show such a delight.

The moon glows full, its light so bright,
Guiding us through the darkness of night.
Nature's beauty shines so bold and free,
A treasure trove for you and me
