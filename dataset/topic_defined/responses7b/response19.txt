Of course! Here is a short poem about love in 7 lines:

Love is a light that shines so bright,
A feeling deep within my heart tonight.
It's the gentle touch that makes my soul ignite,
The warm embrace that makes everything go right.
With you by my side, I know I can face,
Any challenge that life may bring with grace.
