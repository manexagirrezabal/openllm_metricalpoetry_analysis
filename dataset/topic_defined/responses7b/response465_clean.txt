Instance of a moment in time,
A flash of light that doth shine.
A fleeting glimpse of beauty so divine,
That doth leave us in a state of mind.

In an instance, we find our fate,
A choice that doth determine our weight.
Between right and wrong, we make a stand,
And in that moment, our future's hand.

Instance of love, so pure and true,
A feeling that forever shines through.
In an instant, hearts connect and bind,
A bond that doth forever find.

Instance of loss, so dear and true,
A pain that doth forever shine through.
In an instance, life changes course,
Leaving us with a heart of endless force.
