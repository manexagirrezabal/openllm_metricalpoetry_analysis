Attention, a fleeting thing,
Here one moment, gone the next.
It flits and flutters like a bird in flight,
A moment of focus, before it takes flight.

Without attention, life can seem dull and gray,
But with it, every day is brighter and more play.
So let us cherish this elusive gift,
And make the most of every precious lift.
