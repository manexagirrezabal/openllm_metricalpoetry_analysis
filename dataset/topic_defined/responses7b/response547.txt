Of course! Here is a short poem about attention with 8 lines:

Attention, a flower that blooms so bright,
A beauty that's worth cherishing in sight.
Without it, we'd be lost in the night,
Adrift in a world that's not quite right.
So let us cherish this gift from above,
And never take it for granted, love
