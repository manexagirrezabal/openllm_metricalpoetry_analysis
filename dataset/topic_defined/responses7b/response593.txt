Of course! Here is another poem about attention with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

Attention, a treasure so divine
Like a beacon in the darkest night
It shines on us, and brings us light
And guides us through life's plight

In a world that's full of distractions and noise
Attention is a precious gift, a priceless choice
It helps us stay grounded, and centered too
A refuge from the world's confusion anew

Like a gentle breeze on a summer's day
Attention can ease our worries away
It brings us peace and solace too
And helps us find our way

So cherish attention, hold it tight
For in its embrace, all is right and bright
And when it's gone, we'll miss its light
And the darkness will take flight.
