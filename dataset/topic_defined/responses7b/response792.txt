Certainly! Here is a short poem with 7 lines about cells:

Inside each of us, a world so small
Cells divide and multiply with a mighty call
Organs built from them, our body's might
Each one a tiny realm of life and light
Working together, they keep us alive
A microscopic universe inside, where life thrives
