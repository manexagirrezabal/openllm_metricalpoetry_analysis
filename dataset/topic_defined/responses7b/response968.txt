Of course! Here is a short poem about a supermarket in two stanzas:

In the supermarket, rows of shelves are high
With products and prices, to make your heart fly
From fresh produce to canned goods on the go
A world of flavors, for you to know

The cashier scans your items with a smile so bright
As you bag them up, your groceries take flight
You leave the store, feeling satisfied and light
With your treasures in hand, for a tasty night
