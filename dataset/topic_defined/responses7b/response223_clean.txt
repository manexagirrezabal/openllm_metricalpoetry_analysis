In the gardens bloom, so fair and bright,
The flowers dance, in delight.
Their colors shine, like jewels in sight,
As nature's beauty takes flight.

In the skies above, so high and wide,
The clouds drift by, with gentle stride.
Their shapes change, as they float with ease,
As nature's beauty brings us to our knees.

In the nighttime still, so quiet and deep,
The stars shine bright, in endless sleep.
Their twinkle echoes, through the darkness so serene,
As nature's beauty dreams of love unseen
