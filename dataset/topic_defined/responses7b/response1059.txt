Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 7 lines:

The crack of the bat, a sound so bright
A hit takes off, and the crowd's delight
The pitcher throws, the batter swings with might
A home run flies, and the crowd takes flight
The sun sets slow, the night descends
Fans cheer on their team until the end.
