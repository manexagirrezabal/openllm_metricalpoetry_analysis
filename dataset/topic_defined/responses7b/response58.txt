Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a dream that we all desire,
A feeling that sets our souls on fire.
It's the touch of your hand, the sound of your voice,
The warmth of your embrace, my heart's endless choice.

In your arms, I find my home and peace,
Where I can rest and be safe from all release.
With you by my side, our love will forever reign,
A bond so strong, it can withstand any storm or pain
