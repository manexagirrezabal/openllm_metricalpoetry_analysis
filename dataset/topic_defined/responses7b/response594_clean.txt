Attention, a gift so pure and true
Like a ray of sunshine, it shines through
It helps us stay present, and in the now
And brings us joy, beyond all we know

In a world that's filled with distractions and noise
Attention is a treasure, a precious choice
It helps us focus on what's important too
And brings us peace, like a gentle hue

Like a quiet stream that flows so free
Attention can wash away our misery
It brings us clarity, and calmness too
A refuge from the world's wild hue

So cherish attention, hold it tight
For in its embrace, all is right and bright
And when it's gone, we'll miss its light
And the darkness will take flight.
