Sure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the year:

The year goes by, like sand in an hourglass,
Slipping away, and leaving us in the past.
Moments lost, memories to treasure,
As the year unwinds, and new ones unfurled.

In the blink of an eye, a new year begins,
With promises of change, and hopes that spin.
A chance to start anew, to leave behind,
The struggles of the past, and a brighter future to find.
