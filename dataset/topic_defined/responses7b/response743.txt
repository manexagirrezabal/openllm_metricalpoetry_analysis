Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about the year:

The sun sets slow, a fiery hue,
As day gives way to night's sweet brew.
The stars appear, one by one,
And night's silence has just begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful tune,
As autumn leaves their branches moan.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

Year draws to a close, so bright,
With memories both dark and light.
