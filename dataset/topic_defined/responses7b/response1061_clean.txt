The ball flies through the air, a perfect pitch
A runner races around the bases, a thrilling switch
The crowd on their feet, cheering loud and clear
Baseball's magic on display, year after year
From opening day to the championship game
The excitement never fades, it's always the same
In baseball, dreams are made and broken with each swing.
