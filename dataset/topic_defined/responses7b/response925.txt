Of course! Here is another short poem about a supermarket:

The supermarket's shelves so wide,
I find what I need for my family's pride.
Fresh produce, meats, and canned goods too,
I shop for dinner, breakfast, and brew.
In this market place of endless delight,
I find what I need to make everything right
