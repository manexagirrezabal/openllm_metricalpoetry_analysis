Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 14 lines:

The sun sets slow on the diamond bright,
Where players give their all through the night.
The crack of the bat echoes through the air,
As fans cheer on their favorite team beyond compare.

From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a game that's truly devout.
It's more than just a sport, it's a way of life,
A source of joy and excitement, strife and spouse.

So let us cherish this classic American game,
And enjoy the thrill of this timeless dream
