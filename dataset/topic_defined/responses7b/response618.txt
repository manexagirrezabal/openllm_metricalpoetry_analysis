Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the busy world of work,
Where tasks and deadlines never rest,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on top of our nest.

In the quiet moments of thought,
When mind is clear and heart is fraught,
Attention brings us to our core,
And helps us find our inner strength once more.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
