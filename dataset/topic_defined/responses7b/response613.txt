Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the busy hive of town,
Where sounds and sights are all around,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on track and sing.

In the quiet moments of the day,
When thoughts are clear and heart can play,
Attention brings us to our feet,
And helps us find our inner beat.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
