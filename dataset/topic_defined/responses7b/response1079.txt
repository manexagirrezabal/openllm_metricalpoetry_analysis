Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 14 lines:

The green field stretches far and wide,
Where players give their all with pride.
The crack of the bat echoes through the air,
As fans cheer on their favorite team beyond compare.

From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a game that's truly devout.
It's more than just a sport, it's a way of life,
A source of joy and excitement, strife and spouse.

So let us cherish this classic American game,
And enjoy the thrill of this timeless dream
