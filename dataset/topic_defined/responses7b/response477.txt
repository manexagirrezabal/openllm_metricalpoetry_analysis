Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines, about instances:

In an instant, the day transforms
From bright to bleak, without any forms
The sky turns gray, and the wind howls loud
As if it's trying to drown out the crowd

In a flash, the world changes its pace
From fast to slow, without any space
The clock ticks slower, and the minutes stretch
As time stands still, in this instant's reach

In an instant, love can bloom
From nothing more than a single tune
A melody that fills the air
And brings two hearts together, beyond compare

In a split second, fate can spin
From happiness to heartache within
The wheel of fortune turns with a twist
Leaving us wondering, what's next?
