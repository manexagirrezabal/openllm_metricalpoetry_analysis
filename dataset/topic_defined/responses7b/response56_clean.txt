Love is a river that flows and runs,
A current that carries us to fun.
It's the laughter we share, the memories we make,
The comfort of knowing our love will never break.

With you, my heart beats faster than before,
Our love is the rhythm that we adore.
In your arms is where I want to be,
Forever with you, my love, eternally
