In the supermarket aisles, I wander lost
Between the shelves of canned sauce and toast
The fluorescent lights above, they flicker and gleam
As I search for snacks to make my dreams complete

The carts roll by, with groceries in tow
The voices of strangers, as they go "Hey, how's it grow?"
I nod and smile, as I reach for a treat
In this supermarket, where the shopping is sweet
