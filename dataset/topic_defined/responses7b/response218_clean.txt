In forests dark and deep,
Where creatures roam to sleep,
And trees their vigil keep.

On mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And rivers flow with gentle sweep.

In oceans vast and wide,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic tide.

In fields of green so bright,
Where sunflowers bloom with delight,
And bees collect their sweet delight
