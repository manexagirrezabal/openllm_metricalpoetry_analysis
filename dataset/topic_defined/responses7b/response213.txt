Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 3 lines each that focuses on nature:

In meadows green and bright,
Where flowers bloom with delight,
And butterflies their wings take flight.

Through forests dark and deep,
Where creatures roam to sleep,
And trees their vigil keep.

On mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And rivers flow with gentle stream.

In oceans vast and wide,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic tide
