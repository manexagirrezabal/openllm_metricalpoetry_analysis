Of course! Here is a poem with 14 lines about the year:

The year goes by, a tale so bold,
A story of life, with moments to unfold.
From birth to death, it's a journey we take,
With memories made and lessons for our sake.

With every step, a new chapter unfolds,
And with each moment, our hearts are told.
The year unfolds, a tale so true,
A chapter in the book of life that's through
