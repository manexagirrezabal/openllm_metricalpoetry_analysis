Of course! Here is a poem about attention with 4 stanzas:

Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and rare,
A gift we give, but often don't share.
Without it, life blurs, a hazy gray,
A world where focus fades, without a ray.

You grab my gaze, like a bird in flight,
And hold it tight, with a beacon of light.
I melt into you, like snow in the sun,
My mind aflame, with love that's just begun.

Attention is art, a skill to hone,
A gift we give, when we take the time alone.
Without it, connections fade away,
And relationships crumble, come what may.

So cherish attention, like a precious stone,
For in its embrace, our love will be known.
It's the spark that ignites, a fire so bright,
A bond that flourishes, with all of our might.
