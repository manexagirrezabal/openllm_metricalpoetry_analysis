Of course! Here is a poem about the passing of time in four stanzas with three lines each:

Years like a dream, pass by so fast,
Moments lost in time, memories to last.
A lifetime of love, a year to hold dear.

Summer sunshine bright, winter's chill embrace,
Seasons come and go, a constant pace.
Birthdays mark our journey, growth in every stage.

Springtime blooms with hope, summer's heat,
Autumn's hues, a season to retreat.
Winter's snow and ice, a time for rest.

Years like a book, pages turn so slow,
Time's mysterious ways, we can never know.
A cycle of life, forever to be told anew.
