Certainly! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the concept of "instance":

In an instant, memories are born,
A moment that's forever scorn.
The past and present intertwine,
As we relive our lives in a new design.

In an instance, fate can change,
And our paths take on a new range.
Of possibilities and potential,
As we navigate life's twists and turns
