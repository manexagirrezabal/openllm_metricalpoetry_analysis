Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the year:

The year unfolds like a book waiting to be read,
A story filled with chapters yet unsaid.
New adventures wait around each bend,
And we step forward with hearts full of friend.

As we journey through the pages ahead,
We hold on to love that fills our hearts and souls instead.
The year may bring us laughter or tears,
But with every moment, we make the most of life's fears
