Attention, a gift that's often overlooked,
Until it's gone and we're left feeling neglected.
It helps us connect with those around,
And makes each moment count, without a sound.

With attention, we can show we care,
And make each day a brighter, more loving place to share.
So let us cherish this gift with heart and mind,
And give it the focus it deserves to find peace of mind and time
