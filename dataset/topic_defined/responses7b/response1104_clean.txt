The smell of fresh cut grass, so sweet,
Echoes through the land, a treat.
In this game of skill and sport so bright,
Players chase the win with all their might.

With gloves of leather, strong and true,
They catch and throw with skill anew.
From home to first, they race with speed,
And fans hold on to every deed.

The crack of the bat, a symphony so fine,
Echoes through the land, a chorus divine.
With every swing of the bat so sweet,
A tale of heroes is etched in history's beat.

In this game of inches, where victory is won,
The players give their all, until the day is done.
With every out, a tale of grit and might,
A game that's loved by young and old in sight.
