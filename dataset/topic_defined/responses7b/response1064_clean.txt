Absolutely! Here is a short poem about baseball with 8 lines:

The crack of the bat, the smell of fresh cut grass
A home run soars through the sky, a thrilling chase
From opening day to the World Series crown
Baseball's magic never fades, it's always renowned
With every pitch, a new tale unfolds
The excitement builds with each swing and score
In baseball, dreams are made and broken with each roll of the dice.
