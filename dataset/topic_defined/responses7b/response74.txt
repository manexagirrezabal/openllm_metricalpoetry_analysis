Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 4 lines, about love:

Love is a dream that takes flight,
A feeling that's always in sight.
It's a bond that forever holds tight,
A treasure that shines so bright and light.

Love is a river that flows,
A journey that we know.
It's a gift that brings us joy each day,
A treasure that never fades away.

Love is a fire that burns so true,
A feeling that sets our soul anew.
It's a bond that forever makes us whole,
A treasure that we hold in heart and soul.

Love is a heart that beats with grace,
A feeling that fills the space with pace.
It's a gift that brings us joy each day,
A treasure that shines so bright and light
