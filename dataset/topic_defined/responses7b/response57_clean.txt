Love is a flame that burns bright and true,
A passion that fills our hearts anew.
It's the look in your eyes, the touch of your hand,
The whispered words that make my soul stand.

In your embrace, I find my peaceful nest,
Where I can rest my weary heart and be blessed.
With you by my side, I know we'll face the test,
Together our love will forever find its way to success
