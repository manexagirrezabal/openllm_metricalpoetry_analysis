Of course! Here is a poem about baseball with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

The game of baseball, a timeless tale
With players giving their all in hail
For victory, for pride, for sheer delight
In this game of skill that shines so bright and light

The ball flies through the air with speed
As the players show off their skills unsealed
The crowd cheers on with gleeful tread
In this game of magic and endless lead

The pitcher's spin, a wicked delight
As he throws with all his might and sight
The catcher's glove, a barrier in sight
And the runner's feet, they take flight with all their might

The field's fresh cut grass, a joy to see
Where heroes are born and legends be
Baseball's magic lasts for you and me
In this game of skill that shines so bright and free.
