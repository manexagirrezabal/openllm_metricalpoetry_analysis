Of course! Here is a poem I came up with based on your request:

Death is the end, but also a start,
A new chapter in the heart.
It's where we leave our earthly form,
And find eternal peace in the norm.

In death's embrace, we find release,
From the burdens of this world's cease.
Our souls soar free and wild and bright,
In the light of eternal night.

So let us not fear, but face with grace,
The end of our time on this earthly place.
For in death's arms, we find our peace,
And our journey to the next cease.
