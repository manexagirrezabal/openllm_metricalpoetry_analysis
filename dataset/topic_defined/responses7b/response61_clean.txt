Love is a fire that burns deep inside,
A feeling that can't be denied.
It's the smile on your face, the twinkle in your eyes,
The way my heart skips a beat when you pass me by.

In your embrace, I find my peace,
A place where I am free to release.
With every kiss, my love for you grows strong,
Together our hearts will sing along.

Love is a journey we take with each other,
A path that's paved with laughter and weather.
Through the ups and downs, we'll face it together,
And make our love forever and ever.

In your arms, I find my home,
A place where I am safe and never alone.
With you by my side, I know that I can face,
Any challenge that life may bring us with grace.
