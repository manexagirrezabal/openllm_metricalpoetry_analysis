Attention, a spark that ignites,
A flame that flickers with each glance.
It brings us closer to those we hold dear,
And helps us cherish every moment so clear.

With attention, we can see the beauty,
In every face and every feature.
So let us cherish this precious gift with grace,
And make each day a radiant, loving space
