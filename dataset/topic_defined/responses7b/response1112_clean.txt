The sun sets slow and red
As the game comes to an end
A final out, a victory fed
And the fans go wild, their spirits blend

The players' tired legs
After chasing balls and stealing bases
But their passion never flags
In this game of skill and endless races

The field's fresh cut grass
Where heroes are born and legends pass
Baseball's magic lasts
In this game of skill that will forever last

From the dugout to the field
The players give their all
For victory, for pride, for sheer delight
In this game of baseball, standing tall
