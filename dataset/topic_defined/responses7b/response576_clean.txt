Attention, a gift we give and receive,
A bond that strengthens the ties we live.
In this world of distractions, it's easy to lose,
The moments that matter, in the blink of an eye, they go.

So let us be present, and give attention with grace,
To those around us, and the world we embrace.
For in the act of listening, we show we care,
And make the most of the time that is there.
