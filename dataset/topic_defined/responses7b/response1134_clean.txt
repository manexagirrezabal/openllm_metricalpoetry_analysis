On the diamond, heroes rise,
Their skills and strength in the skies,
With every swing of the bat so sweet,
And every pitch a treat to greet.

In the outfield, they chase and run,
Their speed and agility won,
With gloves that snag and throw so true,
And every catch a victory anew.

With every game a story told,
And every season a tale of gold,
Baseball's magic lives on so bold,
And in our hearts forever to hold.
