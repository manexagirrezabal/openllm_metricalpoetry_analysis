In every corner, a cell is found
A tiny unit, but oh so profound
From bacteria to humans, it's the same
A building block of life, it's not just a game

Within each cell, a world unfolds
Where life's processes are told
From growth to reproduction, it's all the same
A miracle of nature, a cell is the frame

As cells divide and multiply with grace
The body's needs are met with pace
A marvel of nature, pure and true
A cell is the foundation, anew
