The pitcher winds up, the batter swings,
A home run soars, and the crowd sings.
The smell of fresh cut grass fills the air,
As players give their all, beyond compare.

From the dugout to the field, they play with heart,
Each game a story, each moment a work of art.
Baseball is more than just a game, you see,
It's a part of American history, set in stone, you'll see.
