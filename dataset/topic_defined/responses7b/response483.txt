Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about instances:

In the instant's embrace, we find our peace
A moment's reprieve from life's ceaseless pace
But in the instance, we must let go
And trust that change will lead us to grow.

With every step, a journey's made
Of moments lived, of memories played
In instances of love, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the present place.

In the flash of light, a tale is told
Of life's adventures, of stories bold
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
