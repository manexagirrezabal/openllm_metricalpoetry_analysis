In the forest deep and green,
Where trees their vigil keep,
And wildflowers bloom unseen.

The mountains rise so high,
With peaks that touch the sky,
And rivers flow with gentle sigh.

The ocean's waves crash bright,
With foam that dances in sight,
And sea creatures swim with delight.

In the field of golden wheat,
Where windflowers bloom so neat,
And bees collect their sweet treat.
