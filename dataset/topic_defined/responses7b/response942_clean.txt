The supermarket's bright lights shine,
A bustling place, where I dine.
From meat to dairy, and fresh produce too,
I find what I need, for me and my crew.

The cashiers ring up my purchase with ease,
My cart full of treats, my shopping spree.
I leave the store, feeling satisfied and light,
In this supermarket, everything's just right.
