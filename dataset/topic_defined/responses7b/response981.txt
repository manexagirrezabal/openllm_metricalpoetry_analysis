Of course! Here's a poem about a supermarket:

Stanza 1:
In the supermarket, bright and wide,
Shelves upon shelves, goods inside,
Fresh produce, canned and dry,
Everything you need, to buy and try.

Stanza 2:
From bread to milk, and eggs to butter,
All the essentials, in each other'sutter,
Canned goods and snacks galore,
A shopper's paradise, that's for sure.

Stanza 3:
Meat and seafood, neatly arrayed,
Fresh and frozen, for all to be paid,
Bakery goods and meals to go,
For a quick and easy home-cooked show.

Stanza 4:
Shoppers roam the aisles with glee,
Carts filled high, for them to see,
Cashiers ring up purchases with speed,
In this supermarket, all can succeed.
