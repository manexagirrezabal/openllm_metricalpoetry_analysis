In the supermarket, shelves are neat and tall
With food and drinks, to make your mouth fall
From fresh fruits to canned goods on the go
A place where hunger is fed, you know

The cashier bags your items with a flourish so bright
As you leave the store, feeling satisfied in sight
The supermarket's magic, it makes our day
With groceries in hand, for a delicious way.
