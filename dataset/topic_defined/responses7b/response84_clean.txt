Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A feeling that takes flight.
It's the warmth we feel deep inside,
A force that cannot be denied.

With love, our hearts take flight,
We soar on wings of delight.
In its embrace, we find our home,
Where we belong, forever known.

Love is a gift from above,
A treasure to cherish and love.
It brings us joy and sets us free,
A feeling that's truly divine to see.

With every beat of its sweet embrace,
We know we are in the right place.
In love's gentle caress, we find peace,
A sense of calm, a world to cease.
