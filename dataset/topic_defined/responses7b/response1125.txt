Of course! Here is a poem about baseball in four stanzas with three lines each:

The ball flies through the air, a perfect flight
Fans on their feet, they're in for a fight
The players hustle hard, they never give up

The pitcher throws tough, the crowd goes wild
A home run is hit, the game is worthwhile
The team works together, they play with pride

Home plate is crossed, the winning score
Fans cheer and chant, they want more
The players give their all, a victory to share

The umpire calls the game, it's time to go
Fans leave the stadium, their spirits aglow
Baseball season ends, but memories last
