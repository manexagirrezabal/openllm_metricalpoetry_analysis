Of course! Here is a short poem about love in 7 lines:

Love is a gentle breeze that soars,
A feeling deep within my heart for evermore.
It's the soft whispers in the dead of night,
The warm embrace that shines with light.
With you by my side, I know I can face,
Any challenge that life may bring with grace.
