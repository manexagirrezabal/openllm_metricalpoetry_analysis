Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines about nature:

The earthy scent of soil and trees,
A fragrance that brings peace to my knees.
The rustling leaves in autumn's breeze,
A symphony of nature's ease.

The mountains tower high and strong,
A challenge to the eye all day long.
Nature's beauty is a treasure true,
A gift for me and you
