Of course! Here is a short poem about love in 7 lines:

Love is a song that fills the air,
A feeling deep within my heart to share.
It's the gentle touch that makes my soul sing,
The warm embrace that makes everything go cling.
With you by my side, I know I can face,
Any challenge that life may bring with grace
