Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the mountains, peaks so high,
Where eagles soar and rivers fly.
The air is crisp, the wind does howl,
And nature's grandeur takes its toll.

In the ocean, waves so blue,
Where sea creatures roam anew.
The tides rise, the sun does set,
And nature's beauty is a threat
