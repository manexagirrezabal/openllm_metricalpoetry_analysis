Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines about nature:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that touches high.
The stars appear one by one at night,
A celestial show such a delight.

The wind whispers secrets in the trees,
A symphony of nature's breeze.
Nature's beauty shines with glee,
A treasure trove for you and me
