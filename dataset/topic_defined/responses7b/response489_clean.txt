In the dance of life, we find our rhythm
A moment's joy, a lifetime of resonance
But in the instance, we must be bold
And trust that change will lead us to a brighter hold.

With every breath, a dream unfolds
Of moments lived, of memories told
In instances of hope, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the present place.

In the spark of creativity, a work is born
A moment's inspiration, a life that's formed
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
