Of course, here is a poem about love in four stanzas, with three lines each:

Love is a journey we embark,
A path that leads us to the heart.
With every step, we find our way,
And discover the beauty of each day.

Love is a fire that burns so bright,
A flame that guides us through the night.
It's the light that helps us see the way,
And brings us to a brighter day.

With love, we find our true self,
A reflection of our heart and soul.
It's the mirror that shows us who we are,
And makes our spirit whole.

Love is a gift that we receive,
A treasure that we can't conceive.
It brings us joy and sets us free,
And makes our life a beautiful spree.
