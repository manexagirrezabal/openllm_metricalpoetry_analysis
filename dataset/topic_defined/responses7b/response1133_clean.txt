In the sun-kissed fields of green,
Where athletes run and dreams are seen,
The game of baseball's magic spell,
Is cast upon the crowds so well.

With bats that crack and balls that fly,
Players dance in mid-air so high,
Their footwork graceful as they leap,
And fancies twirl with joyous creep.

In the outfield, they chase and run,
Their speed and agility won,
With gloves that snag and throw so true,
And every catch a victory anew.
