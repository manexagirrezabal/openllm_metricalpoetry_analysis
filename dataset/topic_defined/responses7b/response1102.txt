Of course! Here is a poem about baseball in four stanzas:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes the heart fly.
In this game of summer days so bright,
Players chase the win with all their might.

With gloves of leather, strong and true,
They catch and throw with skill anew.
From home to first, they race with speed,
And fans hold on to every deed.

The crowd cheers on, a chorus of delight,
As players dance and play under the bright lights.
With every swing of the bat so sweet,
A tale of heroes is etched in history's beat.

In this game of inches, where victory is won,
The players give their all, until the day is done.
With every out, a tale of grit and might,
A game that's loved by young and old in sight.
