The sun sets slow, a fiery glow,
As day gives way to night's soft flow.
The stars appear, one by one,
And night's silence has just begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful cry,
As autumn leaves their branches sigh.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

Year passes on, with memories true,
A journey through, with love anew
