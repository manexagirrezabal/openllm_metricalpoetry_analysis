Of course! Here is a poem with 14 lines about a supermarket:

The supermarket's aisles are so bright,
A place where I find what's in sight.
From fresh produce to canned goods too,
In this supermarket, my shopping spree will do.

The staff are friendly, with smiles so wide,
My shopping trip, is a pure delight.
I roam the shelves, with ease and grace,
In this supermarket, I find my place
