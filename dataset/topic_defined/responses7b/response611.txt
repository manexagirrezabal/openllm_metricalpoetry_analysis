Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the busy hive of life,
Where duties call and deadlines strife,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that makes our spirits sing.

In the quiet moments alone,
When thoughts are deep and feelings known,
Attention brings us to our senses,
And helps us live with purpose and defenses.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that's only found in you
