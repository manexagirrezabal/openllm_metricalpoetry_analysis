Of course, here is a poem with 4 stanzas and 3 lines each about cells:

In the body's tiniest halls,
Cells divide and grow,
Making us who we are.

Their walls are strong and thick,
Protecting what's inside,
A tiny world of wonder.

With DNA that's neat and tidy,
They work in perfect time,
A dance of life and death.

In every part of our body,
Cells are hard at work,
Keeping us alive and free.
