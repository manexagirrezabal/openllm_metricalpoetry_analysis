The supermarket's shelves are so neat,
A place where I find what I need to eat.
From fresh produce to canned goods too,
In this supermarket, my shopping spree will do.

The cashiers ring up my purchase with ease,
My cart full of goods, my shopping spree will please.
I leave the store, feeling satisfied and light,
In this supermarket, everything's just right.
