Of course! Here is a poem about cells with 4 stanzas:

In the body's depths, a world of cells,
Microscopic wonders, busy as hell.
Divided by duty, each one unique,
A universe within, so intricate and meek.

Protein factories churn out strength,
Nuclei pulsate with life's great length.
Mitochondria hum with energy's might,
Cells divide to keep us in sight.

Dendrites stretch, a network vast,
Synapses form, connections vast.
Neurotransmitters dance, a wondrous show,
Brain cells work together, as they grow and know.

Epithelial tissues line the skin,
Barrier against the elements within.
Cilia wave, a gentle breeze,
Exfoliate and renew with ease.

Membranes seal, a vital task,
Cell walls hold, a structure's ask.
Lysosomes break down, a cleanup crew,
Cells keep working, as they do.

The cycle goes on, day and night,
Cells divide, to keep us in sight.
A never-ending process, so divine,
The work of cells, keeping us fine
