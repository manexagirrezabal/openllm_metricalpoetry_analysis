Of course! Here is a poem about baseball in four stanzas with three lines each:

The game is on, the crowd cheers loud
Fans wear their team's colors, proud and proud
The players give their all, they never yield

The pitcher throws hard, the ball soars through the field
A home run is hit, the crowd erupts in delight
The team works together, they play with skill

Home plate is crossed, the winning score
Fans chant and cheer, they want more
The players give their all, a victory to share

The umpire calls the game, it's time to go
Fans leave the stadium, their spirits aglow
Baseball season ends, but memories last
