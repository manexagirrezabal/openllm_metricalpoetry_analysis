Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the year:

The year unwinds like a clock ticking away,
Each moment precious, each day a new way.
New beginnings rise, and endless possibility unfolds,
As we step forward with hearts full of hope and souls.

With every passing day, we make our mark,
Leaving behind a legacy that will forever embark.
The year may bring us joy or strife,
But with each step, we make the most of life's precious time and life
