Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 8 lines:

The sun sets on the field, the game at its height
Players give it their all, as the crowd cheers with might
From opening day to the World Series win
Baseball's magic never ends, it starts again and again
With every pitch, a new chapter unfolds
The excitement builds with each swing and score
In baseball, legends are made and broken with each roll of the dice.
