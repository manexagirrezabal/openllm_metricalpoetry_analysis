The trees sway gently in the breeze,
Their leaves rustling softly like the sea.
The sun shines bright, its rays so warm,
Bringing life to all, no matter the form.

The birds sing sweet melodies,
Their voices echoing through the skies.
Nature's beauty is a sight to see,
A treasure trove of wonder and glee.
