Of course! Here is a poem about the passing of time, with four stanzas of four lines each:

Years go by like waves on the shore
Each one a journey, evermore
Memories made, hearts full of cheer
As we dance through life's rhythm dear

In springtime's bloom, new life begins
Summer sunshine brings warmth and friends spin
Autumn's hue, a season's end
Winter's chill, a time to mend

The cycle spins, the years go by
As we journey through, we reach the sky
With each new dawn, a chance anew
To live, to love, and see it all anew

Time and tide wait for no one's call
Yet in its passage, we stand tall
For in each moment, beauty's found
A year's worth of joy, love, and sound.
