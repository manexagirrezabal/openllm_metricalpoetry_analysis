Of course! Here is another poem about attention with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

Attention, a spark that ignites the soul
Like a flame that burns bright, it makes us whole
It helps us see the world anew
And brings us joy, like a melody true

In a world that's full of distractions and noise
Attention is a treasure, a gift of peaceful choice
It helps us stay grounded, and centered too
A refuge from the world's chaos anew

Like a gentle breeze on a summer's day
Attention can ease our worries away
It brings us peace, and solace too
And helps us find our way

So cherish attention, hold it tight
For in its embrace, all is right and bright
And when it's gone, we'll miss its light
And the darkness will take flight.
