Inside my body, tiny worlds exist,
Cells divide and grow, a never-ending quest.
Within these walls, life's mysteries unfold,
A microscopic realm where secrets are told.

The cell membrane, thin and strong,
Protects the inner workings, where magic's sung.
Enzymes and hormones, they dance and play,
Chemical reactions, life's symphony in gray.

DNA, the blueprint, a code so grand,
Instructions for growth, a plan so land.
Ribosomes, the builders, work with care,
Translating genes, with precision fair and square.

Inside each cell, a universe of might,
A tiny world where life takes flight.
So let us marvel at these small wonders,
For inside each cell, a miracle shines bright and light.

Within each cell, a story unfolds,
Of life and death, of growth and old.
A tale of wonder, of hope and dreams,
Inside each cell, a world of themes to be told
