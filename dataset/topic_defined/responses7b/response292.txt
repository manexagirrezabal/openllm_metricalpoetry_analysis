Death, the great unknown,
A fate we all must face alone.
It comes for us unawares,
And takes us to the other shore.

In life, we search for fame,
But in death, our names are forgot.
The world keeps turning still,
While we lie silently in the dust.

The memories we leave behind,
Are all that's left of us to find.
And though we may be gone,
Our legacy lives on and on
