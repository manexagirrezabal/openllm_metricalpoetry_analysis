Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 7 lines:

The game begins, the players take the field
A throw and a catch, the crowd's delight
The pitcher throws, the batter swings with might
A hit takes flight, and the crowd takes flight
The sun sets slow, the night descends
Fans cheer on their team until the end.
