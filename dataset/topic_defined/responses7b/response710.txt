Of course! Here is a poem about the year, with four stanzas:

The year begins with hope and cheer,
A time for new beginnings, my dear.
The snow falls soft and gentle as can be,
Bringing joy to you and me.

As winter turns to springtime's grace,
The world awakens from its place.
The flowers bloom, the birds sing sweet,
And love is in the air, can't be beat.

Summer sun shines bright and long,
A time for adventures, songs, and throngs.
The laughter echoes through the land,
As friends and family stand hand in hand.

Autumn's hues of gold and red,
A time to slow and savor, my friend.
The harvest yields its bounty grand,
As nature's beauty takes a final stand.
