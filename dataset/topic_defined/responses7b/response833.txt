Of course! Here is a poem about cells in two stanzas:

Inside my body, cells so small and bright,
Working tirelessly through day and night.
Their jobs are many, their tasks so grand,
From regulating hormones to healing the land.

Without them, I wouldn't be me,
My body would be a stranger to see.
So here's to cells, so small but grand,
The unsung heroes of this land
