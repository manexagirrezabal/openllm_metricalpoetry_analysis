Inside the body's tiniest space,
Cells divide with graceful pace,
A tiny world of wonder place.

Their walls are strong and thick with care,
Protecting life inside, so fair and square,
A secret world we can't compare.

With DNA that's neat and tidy, no fray,
Cells work in perfect time, every day,
A dance of life and death, you see.

In every part of our body, no gray,
Cells are hard at work, day after day,
Keeping us alive and free to play
