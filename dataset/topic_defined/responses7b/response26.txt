Of course! Here is a short poem about love in 8 lines:

Love is a dream that we all strive to find,
A feeling that makes our hearts entwined.
It's the way we feel when we're close to you,
The joy and happiness that love brings true.
With every moment we spend together,
Love makes our hearts feel forever younger.
