Of course! Here is another poem about attention with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

Attention, a gift so rare and true
Like a sunrise, it shines bright and new
It listens to our deepest desires
And brings us joy beyond all fires

In a world that's full of noise and strife
Attention is a treasure, a precious life
It helps us focus on what's important too
And brings us peace in the midst of it all anew

Like a gentle stream that flows so free
Attention can wash away our misery
It brings us clarity and calmness too
A refuge from the world's wild hue

So cherish attention, hold it tight
For in its embrace, all is right and bright
And when it's gone, we'll miss its light
And the darkness will take flight.
