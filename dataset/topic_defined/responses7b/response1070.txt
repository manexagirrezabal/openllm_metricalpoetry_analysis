Sure, here is a short poem about baseball with 14 lines:

The crack of the bat, the smell of fresh cut grass,
A home run soars through the sky, what a blast!
The players hustle and play with hearts full of cheer,
As the crowd cheers on their favorite team, year after year.

The green field stretches far and wide,
A symbol of America's favorite game inside.
The peanut vendor calls out his tune,
While the beer flows like a cool summer spree.

Baseball is more than just a game, you see,
It's a piece of American history.
