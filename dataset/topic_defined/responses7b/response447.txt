Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the concept of "instance":

In an instant, time and space are bent,
A moment that's forever meant.
The universe bends to our will,
And we find ourselves in a new thrill.

In an instance, love can bloom,
And hearts are filled with a new tune.
The world slows down its pace,
As we find ourselves in a new place
