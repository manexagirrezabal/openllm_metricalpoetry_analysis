The crack of the bat, a sweet serenade,
Echoes through the land, a symphony played.
From dugout to field, the game unfolds,
A tale of skill, a story told.

With every pitch and swing, a tale emerges,
Of heroes and legends, their names forever preserved.
The smell of fresh cut grass and summer skies,
A time-honored tradition that never dies.

The crowd cheers on, a chorus of delight,
As players dance and play under the bright lights.
From home to first, they race with speed and grace,
A testament to human will and endless space.

In this game of inches, where victory is won,
The players give their all, until the day is done.
With every out, a tale of grit and might,
A game that's loved by young and old in sight.
