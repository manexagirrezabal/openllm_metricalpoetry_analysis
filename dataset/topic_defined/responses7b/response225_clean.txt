In the mountains high, so rugged and steep,
The air is crisp, the views so deep.
The snow falls soft, in gentle touch,
As nature's beauty leaves us in awe.

In the meadows green, so bright and wide,
The sun shines down, with gentle pride.
The flowers bloom, in colors so bold,
As nature's beauty reaches out to hold.

In the stream so clear, that flows so fast,
The water rushes by, in endless haste.
Its glistening surface, a sight to see,
As nature's music fills the landscape free
