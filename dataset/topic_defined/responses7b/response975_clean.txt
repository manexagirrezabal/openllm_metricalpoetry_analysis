Stanza 1:
In the bustling store, so bright and bold,
Fresh produce and goods of every kind are told,
From bread to milk, from eggs to rice,
A culinary journey that never ceases.

Stanza 2:
The shelves are stacked high with goodies galore,
Shoppers roam in search of more,
Fresh fruits and veggies, canned goods too,
A feast for all, whatever they do.

Stanza 3:
Carts loaded with treats so fine,
Shoppers make their final line,
The cashiers ring up the bill with care,
As shoppers leave with a smile and a prayer.

Stanza 4:
As shoppers leave the store so bright,
They feel their bellies full of delight,
The supermarket's magic spell,
A place where dreams are sold so well.
