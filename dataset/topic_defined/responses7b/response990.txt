Of course! Here is a poem about a supermarket with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines:

In the supermarket aisle,
Racks of food, shelves of smile.
 Customers roam, carts abound,
Hungry for groceries, without a sound.

Fresh produce, colorful sight,
Fruits and veggies, shining bright.
The scent of bread, sweet and warm,
Baked in store, a treat to form.

Canned goods, stacked with care,
Soups and beans, beyond compare.
The sound of bags being bagged,
As customers shop, their needs unbagged.

Dairy aisle, milk and more,
Eggs and cheese, the choices are endless.
Bread and butter, staples galore,
Sandwich fixings, for the hunger poor.
