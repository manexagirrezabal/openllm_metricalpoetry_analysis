Of course, here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about instances:

In the blink of an eye, a moment's grace
Can turn to chaos, leave us in disgrace
But in the instance, we find our place
And learn to embrace the here and now with haste.

With every breath, a chance we take
To make our mark, to break the fake
In instances of doubt, we find our voice
And let our spirit soar, rejoicing in the choice.

In the flash of light, a story's told
Of triumphs, losses, and moments bold
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with endless length.
