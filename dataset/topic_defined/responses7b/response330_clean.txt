Death's dark shadow looms before,
A grim reminder of our fate.
No escape from its embrace,
As life slowly fades away.

In the end, we all must meet,
The final curtain call of life.
Our bodies return to earth,
While souls take flight.

Death's a journey we must make,
Through trials and tribulations.
Yet in death, we find peace,
A new life's beginnings.

In the end, death's embrace,
Brings us to eternal rest.
No more suffering or pain,
Just pure bliss and happiness.
