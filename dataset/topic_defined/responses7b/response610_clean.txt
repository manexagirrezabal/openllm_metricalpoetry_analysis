In the quiet hours of dawn,
When darkness fades and light is born,
The world awakens from its sleep,
And new beginnings start to peep.

In the bustling streets of town,
Where people rush and crowds are crowned,
The noise of progress never ceases,
A constant hum of activity pleas.

But in the stillness of the night,
When stars are bright and all is right,
Attention is the greatest gift,
A treasure to be cherished and lifted.
