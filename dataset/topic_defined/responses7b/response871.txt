Of course! Here is a poem with the specifications you provided:

In every living thing, a cell resides
The building block of life, it abides
From plants to animals, it's always there
A tiny unit, but oh so fair and rare

Within each cell, a world unfolds
Where life's processes are told
From growth to reproduction, it's all the same
A miracle of nature, a cell is the game

As cells divide and multiply with glee
The body's needs are met with ease
A marvel of nature, pure and true
A cell is the foundation, anew
