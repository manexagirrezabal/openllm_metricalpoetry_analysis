Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 4 lines, about love:

Love is a journey we all embark,
A feeling that sets our heart and spark.
It's a bond that forever holds us tight,
A treasure that shines so bright and light.

Love is a smile that lights the way,
A feeling that chases night away.
It's a gift that brings us joy each day,
A treasure that never fades away.

Love is a flame that burns so true,
A feeling that sets our soul anew.
It's a bond that forever makes us whole,
A treasure that we hold in heart and soul.

Love is a heart that beats with grace,
A feeling that fills the space with pace.
It's a bond that forever holds us tight,
A treasure that shines so bright and light
