Of course! Here is a poem about attention with 14 lines:

Attention, a treasure to behold,
A gift that's valuable, young and old.
It helps us see the world in a new light,
And makes each moment worth the fight.

With attention, we can learn and grow,
And make the most of every moment we know.
So let us cherish this precious grace,
And give it the focus it deserves with haste.[INST/INSTS]  I'd be happy to help! Here is a poem about attention with 14 lines:

Attention, a delicate thing,
Easily lost, but hard to cling.
It slips away like sand in the hand,
Leaving us with a glimpse of the land.

Without attention, life can seem dull and gray,
But with it, every day is brighter and more play.
So let us cherish this fleeting gift,
And make the most of every precious lift.
