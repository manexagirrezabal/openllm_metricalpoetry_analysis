Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 3 lines each that focuses on nature:

In gardens full of life,
Where flowers bloom and thrive,
And birds their songs do bring.

Through forests dark and deep,
Where creatures roam to sleep,
And trees their vigil keep.

On mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And rivers flow with gentle sweep.

In oceans vast and wide,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic tide
