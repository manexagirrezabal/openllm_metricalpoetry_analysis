Of course! Here's a poem about baseball in two stanzas:

The crack of the bat, the smell of fresh cut grass,
A game of skill and strategy, where players are blessed.
From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a sport that's full of doubt.

With every swing and every throw,
Players give it their all, as they know.
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat,
Baseball brings it all, on the field to compete.
