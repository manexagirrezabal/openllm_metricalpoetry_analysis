Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the forest, shadows deep,
Where creatures roam and secrets keep.
The trees their vigilance maintain,
And nature's beauty in the forest reign.

In the meadow, flowers so bright,
Where bees and butterflies take flight.
The sun shines down, the breeze is light,
And nature's beauty in the meadow takes flight
