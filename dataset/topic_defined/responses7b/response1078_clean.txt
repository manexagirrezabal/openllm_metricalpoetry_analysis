The sun shines bright on the diamond so green,
Where players give their all, a sight unseen.
The crack of the bat echoes through the air,
As fans cheer on their favorite team beyond compare.

From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a game that's truly devout.
It's more than just a sport, it's a way of life,
A source of joy and excitement, strife and spouse.

So let us cherish this classic American game,
And enjoy the thrill of this timeless dream
