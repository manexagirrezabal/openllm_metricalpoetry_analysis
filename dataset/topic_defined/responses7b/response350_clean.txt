Death comes for us all in time,
A silent visitor, a final goodbye.
It's where we'll all end up, alas,
But for now, let's cherish life's sweet gasps.

In the end, it's just you and me,
Facing death with dignity.
Let's make the most of every day,
And savor life's fleeting ray.

Death is a journey we must take,
But let's not think of it as a mistake.
For in its embrace, we find peace,
And our souls are set free to release.
