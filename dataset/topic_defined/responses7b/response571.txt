Of course! Here is a poem about attention with two stanzas:

Attention, a gift we give and receive,
A treasure that makes life worth living.
In this world of distractions, it's easy to lose,
The moments that matter, in the blink of an eye, they go.

So let us be present, and give attention with care,
To those around us, and the world we share.
For in the act of listening, we show we care,
And make the most of the time that is there.
