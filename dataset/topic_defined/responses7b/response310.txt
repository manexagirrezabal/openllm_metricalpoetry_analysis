Of course, here is a poem about death in two stanzas:

Death is the end of life's short span,
A moment's pause before eternity's plan.
It brings an end to all our dreams and schemes,
Leaving us with memories of what could be.

In death, we find peace from life's strife,
A quiet rest after a world full of strive.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and joy remain.
