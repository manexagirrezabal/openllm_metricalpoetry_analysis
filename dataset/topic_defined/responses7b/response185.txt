Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the fields, wildflowers so bright,
Where bees and butterflies take flight.
The sun shines down, the breeze is light,
And nature's beauty in the fields takes flight.

In the forest, trees so tall and grand,
Where creatures roam and secrets stand.
The wind does whisper, the leaves do dance,
And nature's beauty in the forest prances
