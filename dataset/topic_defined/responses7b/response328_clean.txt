Death, the great transition,
A journey we all must take alone,
Leaving behind our mortal form,
To find peace in the afterlife's storm.

In the end, it's not what we own or know,
But how we lived and loved below,
That will be remembered when we're gone,
And our legacy lives on and on.

The grave may keep its secret,
But our memories will never depart,
For though our bodies fade away,
Our spirits live on in the heart and soul, and art.

Death may be the end of life,
But it's not the end of love and light,
For though we leave this world behind,
Our souls shine on, forever in sight
