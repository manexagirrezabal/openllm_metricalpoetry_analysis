Stanza 1:
In the heart of town, a place to go,
Where groceries and goods are in tow,
The supermarket's bustling hive,
A shopper's paradise alive.

Stanza 2:
From aisle to aisle, shelves so high,
Fresh produce, canned goods nigh,
Shoppers roam with purpose and glee,
In search of treats for tea.

Stanza 3:
Carts filled with goodies galore,
Shoppers check their lists once more,
The cashiers ring up the bill,
As shoppers make their final thrill.

Stanza 4:
As shoppers leave the store so bright,
They feel their bellies full of delight,
The supermarket's magic spell,
A place where dreams are sold so well.
