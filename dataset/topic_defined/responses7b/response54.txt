Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a force that moves the earth,
A power that gives us wings to soar and flourish.
It's the beat of hearts, the flow of tears,
The bond that keeps us near.

With you, my love, I know we'll always be,
A love that's strong and pure, a love that's meant to be.
Together we'll face whatever life may bring,
With love as our guide, our hearts will forever sing
