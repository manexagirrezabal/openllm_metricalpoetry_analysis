Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines about nature:

The world outside is full of life,
A kaleidoscope of colors thrive.
From mountains high to valleys low,
Nature's beauty never fails to show.

The wind whispers secrets in the trees,
A symphony of nature's breeze.
The flowers bloom with vibrant hues,
A masterpiece of colors anew
