Of course! Here is a poem I came up with based on your request:

Death approaches, inevitable and near,
A shadow that looms, casting fear.
But let us not fear, for it's a friend,
Who will guide us to the end.

In death's embrace, we find reprieve,
From the pains and sufferings we've received.
It's where our souls are set free at last,
And our bodies find eternal rest.

So let us not resist, but surrender,
To death's gentle touch, a love letter.
For in its arms, we'll find our peace,
And our journey will cease.
