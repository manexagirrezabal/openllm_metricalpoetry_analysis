Strike one, the ball is in the air
Fans on their feet, cheering loud and fair
The pitcher winds up, the crowd holds its breath

Strike two, the umpire's call is clear
A swing and a miss, the batter's fear
The game is heating up, the tension high

Home run! The ball soars through the night
Fans erupt in cheers, a joyful sight
The crowd goes wild, a magical flight

Stolen base! The runner takes off with ease
A quick slide into second, a successful breeze
The team works together, a well-rehearsed play
