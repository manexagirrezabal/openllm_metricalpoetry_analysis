Of course! Here is a poem about the passing of time in four stanzas with three lines each:

Years like a dance, moving to a beat,
Moments lost in time, memories to seal.
A lifetime of love, a year to repeat.

Summer sunshine bright, winter's chill embrace,
Seasons come and go, a constant race.
Birthdays mark our journey, growth in every place.

Springtime blooms with hope, summer's heat,
Autumn's hues, a season to retreat.
Winter's snow and ice, a time for rest.

Years like a song, singing its final verse,
Time's mysterious ways, we can never disperse.
A cycle of life, forever to be told anew with love.
