Of course! Here is a poem with 14 lines about the year:

The year goes by, a fleeting dream,
A cycle of time, a moment seen.
From birth to death, it's a journey we take,
With memories made and lessons for our sake.

The seasons turn, a tale they tell,
Of growth and change, of life so well.
The year unfolds, a story long,
A chapter in the book of life that's strong.
