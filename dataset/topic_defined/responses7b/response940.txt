Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines about a supermarket:

In the supermarket aisles I roam,
Amongst the shelves and products of home.
From canned goods to fresh produce I see,
A place where shopping is a breeze for me.

The prices on the shelves are clear to see,
And the staff are friendly, as can be.
I shop with ease, my cart full of delight,
In this supermarket, everything's just right.
