Of course! Here is a short poem with 7 lines about cells:

Tiny structures, busy and quick
Cells divide and multiply with skill and trick
Organs built from them, our body's strength
Each one a microscopic world of life and length
Working together, they keep us whole
A tiny universe inside, where life unfolds
