Love is a flame that flickers bright,
Burning deep within our hearts tonight.
It's a feeling that can never grow old,
A bond that will forever be told.

With every beat of my heart, I feel,
The love we share, it's hard to conceal.
In your eyes, my soul finds its home,
Forever with you, my love will roam.
