Of course! Here is a poem with 14 lines about a supermarket:

The supermarket's bright lights shine,
A place where I find what's divine.
From fresh produce to canned goods too,
In this supermarket, my shopping spree will do.

The staff are friendly, with smiles so bright,
My shopping trip, is a pure delight.
I roam the shelves, with ease and grace,
In this supermarket, I find my place
