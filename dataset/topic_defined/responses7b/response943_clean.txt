From the moment I step inside,
A world of goods, at my side.
Fresh produce, canned goods too,
The supermarket, has it all for me and you.

The shelves are stocked, with care and might,
My shopping trip, is a pleasure in sight.
I roam the aisles, with ease and grace,
In this supermarket, I find my place.
