Inside my body, a tiny world,
A universe of cells, so unfurled.
From skin to bone, to organs deep,
They work together, in harmony to keep.

Their tasks are varied, their jobs so grand,
From pumping blood to sending signals land.
They are the building blocks of life, you see,
The foundation of my body's symphony.
