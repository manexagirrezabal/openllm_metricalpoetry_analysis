Love is a force that moves the earth,
A power that gives us new birth.
It's the energy that makes our hearts sing,
And brings joy to everything.

Love is a river that flows so deep,
A current that never stops or sleeps.
It's the stream that quenches every thirst,
And brings us to a loving crust.

With love, we find our way to peace,
A feeling that never ceases.
It's the calm that soothes our soul,
And makes our life whole.

Love is a gift that we receive,
A treasure that we can't conceive.
It brings us joy and sets us free,
And makes our life a beautiful spree.
