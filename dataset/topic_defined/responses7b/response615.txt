Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the busy world of today,
Where tasks and to-do's delay,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on track and bring.

In the quiet moments of rest,
When body and mind find their best,
Attention brings us to our soul,
And helps us find our inner goal.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
