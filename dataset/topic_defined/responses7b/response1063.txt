Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 8 lines:

From the opening bell to the final whistle
Baseball's magic never loses its grip
Players give it their all, as the crowd cheers on
With every swing, a new chapter unfolds
The excitement builds with each play and score
In baseball, legends are made with each roll of the dice
