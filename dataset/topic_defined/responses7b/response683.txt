Of course! Here is a poem with 14 lines about the year:

The year unfolds, a story so bright,
A chapter in the book of life that's tight.
With every step, a new path we find,
And with each moment, our hearts entwined.

From dawn till dusk, the year goes by,
A journey of growth, with laughter and sighs.
With every passing day, new memories made,
And lessons learned, for life to be played
