Of course! Here is a poem about cells in two stanzas:

Inside my body, cells so small and bright,
Working tirelessly through day and night.
They're the building blocks of life, you see,
The foundation of my health spree.

Without them, I wouldn't be whole,
My body would be weak and cold.
So here's to cells, so small but grand,
The unsung heroes of this land!
