Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 3 lines each that focuses on nature:

In valleys green and wide,
Where rivers flow with gentle pride,
And trees their vigil keep.

On mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And windflowers dance with joyful leap.

In oceans vast and deep,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic sweep.

In meadows green and gold,
Where flowers bloom and thrive,
And butterflies their wings unfold
