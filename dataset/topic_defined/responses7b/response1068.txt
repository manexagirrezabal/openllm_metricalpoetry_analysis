Certainly! Here is a short poem about baseball with 8 lines:

The ball flies through the air, a perfect flight
A runner races around the bases, a thrilling sight
From opening day to the final game
Baseball's magic never fades away, it stays the same
With every pitch, a new story unfolds
The excitement builds with each swing and score
In baseball, dreams are made and broken with each roll of the dice.
