Of course! Here is a poem about love in four stanzas:

Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A feeling that takes flight.
It's the warmth that fills my heart,
And sets us apart.

In your eyes, I see a light,
A love that shines so bright.
With every touch, it grows,
And makes my heart glows.

Love is a journey we embark,
Together hand in hand.
With every step, our hearts grow stronger,
Our bond will forever stand.

In your arms, I find my home,
A place where I am free to roam.
With you by my side, I know,
That love will forever glow.
