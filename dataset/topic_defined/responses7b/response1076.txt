Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 14 lines:

The smell of fresh cut grass fills the air,
Where players give their all beyond compare.
The crack of the bat echoes through the ground,
As fans cheer on their favorite team around.

From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a game that's truly devout.
It's more than just a sport, it's a way of life,
A source of joy and excitement, strife and spouse.

So let us cherish this classic American game,
And enjoy the thrill of this timeless dream
