Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the year:

The year spins round like a carousel in motion,
A never-ending ride of change and emotion.
New experiences come and go,
And we hold on tight to the moments that glow.

As the days pass by, we make our way through,
Learning, growing, and finding our true hue.
The year may ebb and flow with ups and downs,
But we rise to every challenge with wings unbound.
