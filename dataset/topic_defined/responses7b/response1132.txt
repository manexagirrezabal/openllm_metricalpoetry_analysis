Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas, each with 4 lines, and a final two-line stanza about baseball:

On the field of dreams they play,
Their hearts and souls in every way,
With passion burning bright and true,
And every game a victory anew.

With bats that crack and balls that fly,
Players dance in mid-air so high,
Their footwork graceful as they leap,
And fancies twirl with joyful creep.

In the stands, fans cheer and shout,
As players give their all without a doubt,
With every play a story to be told,
And every game a victory to unfold.[INST: <<INST0>><</INST0>>]
