Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the rush of daily life,
Where tasks and to-do's thrive,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on track and strive.

In the quiet moments of peace,
When thoughts are clear and heart can cease,
Attention brings us to our core,
And helps us find our inner release.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
