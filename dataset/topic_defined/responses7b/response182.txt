Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the desert, sand so bright,
Where cacti stand and sun does take flight.
The heat is fierce, the winds do blow,
And nature's beauty in the desert glow.

In the garden, flowers so fair,
Where bees and butterflies do flit and play.
The scent of blooms, the warmth of sun,
And nature's beauty in the garden fun
