Of course, here is a short poem about love in 7 lines:

Love is a flame that burns bright and true,
A feeling deep within my heart anew.
It's the warm embrace I long to hold,
The tender touch that makes my soul unfold.
With you by my side, I know I can face,
Any challenge that life may bring with grace.
