The year goes by, a journey so grand,
A tale of time, with moments at hand.
From birth to death, it's a path we take,
With memories made and lessons for our sake.

With every step, a new story unfolds,
And with each moment, our hearts are told.
The year unfolds, a tale so true,
A chapter in the book of life that's through
