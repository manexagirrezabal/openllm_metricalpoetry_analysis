The crack of the bat, a symphony
As the ball soars through the sky
A home run, a dream come true
In this game of magic and wonder why

The pitcher's spin, a work of art
As he throws with all his might
The catcher's glove, a barrier to part
And the runner's feet, they take flight

The crowd's roar, a deafening sound
As fans cheer on their team with glee
Baseball's magic, a joy to be found
In this game of skill and strategy, you see

The field's fresh cut grass
Where heroes are born and legends pass
Baseball's magic lasts
In this game of skill that will forever last
