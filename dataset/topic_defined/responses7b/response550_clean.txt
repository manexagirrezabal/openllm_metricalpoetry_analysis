Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and bright
A moment of focus, before drifting away tonight
Like a butterfly, it flits from flower to flower
Gathering nectar, but never staying for an hour

In a world of distractions, it's hard to keep hold
Of something so delicate, so quickly to fold
But when we give it our fullest attention and care
The beauty of life becomes clear.
