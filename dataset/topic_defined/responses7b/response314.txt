Of course, here is a poem about death in two stanzas:

Death, the final frontier of all,
A journey we'll take, when our time has come to fall.
It brings an end to life's short span,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been, if only we could plan.

In death, we find release from pain,
A final rest after life's vain strain.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and peace remain.
