Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about the year:

The year stretches out before us like a road,
Long and winding, full of twists and turns to know.
New horizons beckon, and we step forward with hope,
Ready to embrace whatever the year may bring.

With every step, we make our way through the days,
Learning, growing, and finding our own special way.
The year may bring us joy or strife,
But with each moment, we make the most of life's precious time
