Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas, each with 4 lines, and a final two-line stanza about baseball:

In the sun-kissed fields of green,
Where athletes run and dreams are seen,
The game of baseball's magic spell,
Is cast upon the crowds so well.

With bats that crack and balls that fly,
Players dance in mid-air so high,
Their footwork graceful as they leap,
And fancies twirl with joyous creep.

The crowd's cheers rise to the sky,
As players give their all a try,
With passion burning in each soul,
And every play is a goal to hold.
