Of course! Here is a short poem with 14 lines about the concept of "instance":

A moment in time, frozen and still,
A snapshot of life, unfurled.
A glimpse of joy, a burst of pride,
A fleeting instance, never to hide.

It's here and then it's gone, you see,
A flash of light, a memory.
A brief encounter, pure and true,
An instance of love, forever new.
