A year of laughter, love, and light,
Filled with memories that shine so bright.
From dawn till dusk, each day is new,
A time for growth, and things to do.
The seasons change, the winds they blow,
As we journey through this world below.
Year after year, life goes on,
With ups and downs, but still we carry on.
