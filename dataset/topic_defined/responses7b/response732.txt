Of course! Here is a poem about the passing of time in four stanzas with three lines each:

Years like rivers flow, endless and free,
Time's unstoppable march, for you and me.
Moments lost in time, memories to hold dear,
A lifetime of love, a year to bring near.

Summer sunshine bright, winter's chill embrace,
Seasons come and go, a constant pace.
Birthdays mark our journey, growth in every stage,
A lifetime of experiences, a tale to be told with pride and grace.

Springtime blooms with hope, summer's heat,
Autumn's hues, a season to retreat.
Winter's snow and ice, a time for rest,
Nature's rhythm, ever-changing guest.

Years like pages turn, stories yet untold,
Time's mysterious ways, we can never grow old.
A cycle of life, forever to be told,
A year like no other, a story to unfold.
