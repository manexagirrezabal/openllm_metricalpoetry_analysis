The sun sets slow, a fiery hue,
As day gives way to night's soft brew.
The stars appear, one by one,
And night's silence has just begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful cry,
As autumn leaves their branches sigh.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

Year moves on, with steps so light,
A journey through, with love in sight
