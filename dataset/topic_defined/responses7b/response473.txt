Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines, about instances:

In an instant, the world can change
From bright to dark, without any range
The sky turns gray, and the wind howls loud
As if it's trying to drown out the crowd

In a flash, memories can fade
From sharp to hazy, without any shade
The moments we shared, now lost in time
Leaving us with nothing but rhyme

In an instant, love can bloom
From nothing more than a single tune
A melody that fills the air
And brings two hearts together, beyond compare

In a split second, life can shift
From calm to chaos, without any drift
The wheel of fortune turns with a twist
Leaving us wondering, what's next?
