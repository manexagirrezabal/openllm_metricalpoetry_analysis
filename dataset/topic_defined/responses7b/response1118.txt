Of course! Here is a poem about baseball with 4 stanzas and 4 lines each:

The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet
As the ball flies through the summer heat
A home run, a dream come true
In this game of skill that shines bright and new

The pitcher's spin, a work of art
As he throws with all his might and heart
The catcher's glove, a barrier to part
And the runner's feet, they take flight from the start

The field's fresh cut grass, a sight so green
Where heroes are born and legends be seen
Baseball's magic lasts for you and me
In this game of skill that shines bright and free

The crowd's roar, a deafening sound
As fans cheer on their team with joy profound
Baseball's magic, a feeling all around
In this game of skill that will forever be found
