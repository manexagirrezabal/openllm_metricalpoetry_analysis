Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about instances:

In the fleeting moment, we find our peace
A moment's reprieve from life's ceaseless pace
But in the instance, we must decide
To let go or to hold on with all our might.

With every step, a journey's made
Of triumphs and of moments played
In instances of change, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the new place.

In the briefest glance, a life is lived
A story told, a chapter turned
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
