In an instant, the world can change,
A moment that alters our range.
Reality shifts and new paths unfurl,
As we navigate life's twists and whirl.

In an instance, dreams take flight,
And we soar through the night with all our might.
The stars align in a new way,
And we find ourselves in a brighter day
