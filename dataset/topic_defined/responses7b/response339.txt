Of course! Here is a poem about death with 4 stanzas of 4 lines each:

Death's dark veil doth fall,
A somber sight to see.
The end of life's sweet call,
A time for us to be free.

In the land of eternal sleep,
We'll find our final rest.
Where dreams of life are sealed,
And all our cares are swept away.

Death's gentle touch doth claim,
The lives that earth does hold.
But in death's peaceful frame,
We'll find a soul to unfold.

In death's embrace we'll find,
A love that knows no end.
For though it takes us home,
Our spirits will transcend
