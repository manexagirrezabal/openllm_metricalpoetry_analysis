Of course! Here is a short poem with 7 lines about cells:

Microscopic wonders, busy and bright
Cells divide and multiply with all their might
Organs built from them, our body's frame
Each one a tiny universe, life's great game
Working together, they keep us alive
A world within, where magic thrives
