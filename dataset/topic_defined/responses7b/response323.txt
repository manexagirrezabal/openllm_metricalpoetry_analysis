Of course, here is a poem about death in four stanzas:

Death, the great unknown,
A fate we all must face alone,
Leaving behind our mortal frame,
To find peace in the afterlife's domain.

In the end, it's not what we do,
But how we live and love anew,
That will be remembered when we're gone,
And our legacy lives on and on.

The grave may keep its secret,
But our memories will never depart,
For though our bodies fade away,
Our spirits live on in the heart and soul.

Death may be the end of life,
But it's not the end of love and light,
For though we leave this world behind,
Our souls shine on, forever in sight
