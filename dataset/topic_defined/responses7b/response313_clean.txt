Death, the great unknown, so vast and wide,
A mystery that we cannot hide.
It brings an end to life's brief shine,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been divine.

In death, we find peace from life's strife,
A quiet rest after a world full of strive.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and joy remain.
