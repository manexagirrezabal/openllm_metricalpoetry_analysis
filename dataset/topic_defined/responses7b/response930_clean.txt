In the supermarket aisles I stroll,
A world of goods and treats to behold.
Fresh produce, meats, and canned goods too,
All at my fingertips, waiting for me to do.
The colors, smells, and sounds entice,
A sensory feast, a shopper's delightful spree.
With every trip, a new adventure awaits,
In this supermarket, where the world converges with ease.
