Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas and a final two-line line about attention:

In the bustling streets of town,
Where sounds and sights are all around,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on track and wear.

In the quiet moments of rest,
When body and mind find their best,
Attention brings us to our soul,
And helps us find our inner quest.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
