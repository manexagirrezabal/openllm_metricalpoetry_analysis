Attention, a flame that flickers bright,
A treasure that makes life worth the fight.
In this world of distractions, it's easy to lose,
The moments that matter, in the blink of an eye, they go.

So let us be present, and give attention with love,
To those around us, and the world above.
For in the act of listening, we show we care,
And make the most of the time that is there.
