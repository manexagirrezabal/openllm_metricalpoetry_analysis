In woods so green, where trees do stand,
The birds sing sweet, the wind does hand.
The flowers bloom, their colors bright,
And in the air, a scent takes flight.

In fields of gold, where sun does shine,
The grass grows green, the sky is divine.
The clouds are white, the breeze is light,
And in the distance, an eagle takes flight.

On mountains high, where peaks do rise,
The wind howls strong, the rocks do prize.
The snow falls soft, the ice does grip,
And in the valleys, life does rip.

In deserts hot, where sand doth lie,
The sun beats down, the wind doth cry.
The cactus grows, its spines so sharp,
And in the oasis, life does start.
