Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 3 lines each that focuses on nature:

Through forests deep and wide,
Where animals roam inside,
And trees their vigil keep.

In mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And rivers flow with gentle sleep.

On fields of green so vast,
Where wildflowers bloom so fast,
And windflowers dance with joyful grace.

In oceans blue and wide,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic embrace
