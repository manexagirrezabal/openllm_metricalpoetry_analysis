Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about instances:

In the twinkling of an eye, we find our way
A moment's guidance, a new path to slay
But in the instance, we must be brave
And trust that change will lead us to a better wave.

With every step, a journey's made
Of moments lived, of memories played
In instances of hope, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the present place.

In the blink of an eye, a dream unfolds
A moment's magic, a life that's told
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
