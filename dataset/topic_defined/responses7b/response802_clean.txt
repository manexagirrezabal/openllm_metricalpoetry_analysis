Inside of me, a world so small,
A universe within my body's wall.
Cells divide and multiply with grace,
The building blocks of life in this place.
They work together, a delicate dance,
To keep me alive, a wondrous trance.
With every breath, they toil and strive,
A never-ending task, their hearts alive.
