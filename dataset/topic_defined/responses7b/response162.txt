Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines about nature:

The flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
A kaleidoscope of colors anew.
Their sweet fragrance fills the air,
A delight for all to share.

The ocean waves crash on the shore,
A soothing melody evermore.
The tides ebb and flow with grace,
A reminder of nature's embrace.
