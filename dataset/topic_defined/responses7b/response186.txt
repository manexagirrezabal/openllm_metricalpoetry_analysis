Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the mountains, peaks so high,
Where eagles soar and rivers fly.
The air is crisp, the wind does howl,
And nature's grandeur takes its toll.

In the meadow, flowers so bright,
Where bees and butterflies take flight.
The sun shines down, the breeze is light,
And nature's beauty in the meadow takes flight
