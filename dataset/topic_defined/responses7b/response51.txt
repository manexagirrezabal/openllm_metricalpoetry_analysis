Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a gentle breeze that carries me away,
To a place where time stands still and all is okay.
It's the smile on your face, the twinkle in your eye,
The warm embrace that makes my heart sing "I do".

In your arms, I find my peaceful nest,
Where I can rest my weary soul and be blessed.
Love is a gift that fills my life with light,
A shining star that guides me through the night.
