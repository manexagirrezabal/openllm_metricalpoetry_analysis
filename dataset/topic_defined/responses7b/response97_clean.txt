In the morning light, I see your face so bright
A smile that fills my heart with joy and delight
Your eyes, they shine like stars in endless space
A love that knows no bounds, a love so pure and vast.

In the evening, when the sun sets low
Our love is tested, as the day grows slow
The world outside may fade to grey
But with you by my side, I know we'll always stay.

In the silence of the night so deep
Our love will find its way, it will never sleep
For in your eyes, my heart finds rest
With you, my love, I am forever blessed.
