In gardens full of life,
Where flowers bloom and thrive,
And bees collect their sweet strife.

On mountains high and steep,
With peaks that touch the sky so bright,
And rivers flow with gentle sweep.

In oceans vast and wide,
Where sea creatures swim inside,
And waves crash with a rhythmic tide.

In meadows green and gold,
Where flowers bloom and thrive,
And butterflies their wings unfold
