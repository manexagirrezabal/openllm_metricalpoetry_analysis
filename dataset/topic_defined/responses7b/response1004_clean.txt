In the supermarket, I find my haven,
A place where I can escape the fray.
From fresh produce to canned delight,
I fill my cart with joy in sight.

The colors and lights of the store entice,
Sweet treats and savory fare, my heart's excise.
With each item I place in my cart with care,
I know I'll find peace beyond compare.

In this bustling space I find my solace,
A refuge from the world's ceaseless noise.
Wherever life may take me far or near,
The supermarket will always be dear.
