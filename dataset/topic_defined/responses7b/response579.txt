Of course! Here is a poem about attention with two stanzas:

Attention, a spark that ignites the soul,
A treasure that makes life worth the goal.
In this world of distractions, it's easy to lose,
The moments that matter, in the blink of an eye, they go.

So let us be present, and give attention with love,
To those around us, and the world we embrace.
For in the act of listening, we show we care,
And make the most of the time that is there.
