The crack of the bat, the ball flies free
Fans cheer and clap, they're part of the spree
The game is on fire, the excitement grows

The pitcher throws tough, the crowd goes wild
A home run is hit, the game is worthwhile
The team works together, they play with skill

Home plate is crossed, the winning score
Fans chant and cheer, they want more
The players give their all, a victory to share

The umpire calls the game, it's time to go
Fans leave the stadium, their spirits aglow
Baseball season ends, but memories last
