Death, the great equalizer,
A fate we all must face,
Leaving behind our mortal lives,
To find solace in the embrace.

In the end, it's not what we own,
Or who we know or love,
But how we lived and loved,
That will be remembered above.

The grave will keep its secret,
And the dead will rest in peace,
While those who mourn will find solace,
In their memories and tears to cease.

Death may be the end of life,
But it's not the end of love,
For though our bodies fade away,
Our spirits live on from above.
