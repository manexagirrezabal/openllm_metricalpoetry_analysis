Of course! Here is a poem about attention with 4 stanzas and 3 lines each:

Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and bright,
A flash of insight in the morning light.
But soon it's gone, lost in the haze of day,
And we're left with nothing but a fading ray.

In the rush of life, we often miss the signs,
The whispers of the world that pass us by.
But if we slow our pace and open up our minds,
We might just find the beauty in the sky.

Attention is a gift, a treasure to behold,
A chance to see the world with fresh eyes old.
So let's be mindful of the moments we share,
And cherish each one with love and care.

In a world that's full of noise and distractions,
Attention is a rare and precious possession.
Let's not take it for granted or waste it away,
But savor every moment, come what may.
