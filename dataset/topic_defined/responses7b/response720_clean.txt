Year after year, we live and grow
Learning, loving, and letting go
The seasons turn, the days pass slow
As memories made, hearts glow

In springtime's bloom, new life begins
Summer sunshine brings warmth and friendships spin
Autumn's hue, a season's end
Winter's chill, a time to mend

The cycle spins, the years fly by
As we journey through, we reach the sky
With each new dawn, a chance anew
To live, to love, and see it all anew

Time and tide wait for no one's call
Yet in its passage, we stand tall
For in each moment, beauty's found
A year's worth of joy, love, and sound.
