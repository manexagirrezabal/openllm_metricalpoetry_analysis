Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each and a final two-line stanza about the year:

The sun sets slow, a fiery glow,
As day gives way to night's soft flow.
The stars appear, one by one,
And night's silence has just begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful cry,
As autumn leaves their branches sigh.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

Year ends, a tale of love and loss,
With memories that will forever last.
