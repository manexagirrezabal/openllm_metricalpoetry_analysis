Of course, here is a short poem about love in 8 lines:

Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Warming hearts and souls by day and night.
It's a feeling that cannot be bought or sold,
A gift that's priceless, beyond control.
With love, the world is a better place,
Bringing joy and happiness to each embrace.
