In the moment's pause, we find our breath
A chance to steady ourselves and find our death
But in the instance, we must be brave
And face the future with a heart full of hope.

With every beat, a rhythm made
Of moments lived, of love displayed
In instances of joy, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the present space.

In the flicker of an eye, a tale is told
Of dreams and nightmares, of life's gold
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
