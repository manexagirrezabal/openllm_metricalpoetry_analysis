Love is a dream that takes flight,
A feeling that's always in sight.
It's a bond that forever holds us tight,
A treasure that shines so bright and light.

Love is a touch that sets us free,
A feeling that brings us serenity.
It's a gift that fills our lives with glee,
A treasure that we hold in sweet symphony.

Love is a smile that lights the way,
A feeling that chases night away.
It's a bond that forever makes us whole,
A treasure that shines so bright and light.

Love is a heart that beats with grace,
A feeling that fills the space with pace.
It's a gift that brings us joy each day,
A treasure that we hold in heart and soul
