Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 4 lines, about love:

Love is a force that moves the earth,
A feeling that gives birth.
It's a flame that burns so bright and true,
A gift that's always new.

Love is a river that flows,
A journey that we know.
It's a bond that forever grows,
A treasure that we hold.

Love is a smile so wide and bright,
A feeling that takes flight.
It's a gift that brings us joy tonight,
A treasure beyond delight.

Love is a heart that beats with grace,
A feeling that fills the space.
It's a bond that forever embraces,
A treasure that we hold in trust.[INST:
