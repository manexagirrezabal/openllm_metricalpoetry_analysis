Of course, here is a poem about death with 4 stanzas of 3 lines each:

Death's cold embrace I feel around me now,
A shroud of darkness that doth shroud the ground.
The wind it howls, a mournful sound,
As life's last breath is slowly lost, profound.

In death's dark realm I find my peace at last,
From all my woes and troubles free at last.
No more will pain or sorrow seize the day,
But in eternal slumber I shall find my way.

Death's icy grip it doth relinquish slow,
As life's sweet memories begin to fade away.
The weight of years it starts to let go,
And in the grave I shall be free at last to know.

In death's cold arms I find my final rest,
Where all my worries and my cares are blessed.
No more will fear or sorrow plague my mind,
But in the silence I shall find my final find.
