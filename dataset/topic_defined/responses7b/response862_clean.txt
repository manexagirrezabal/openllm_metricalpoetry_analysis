Inside the body's tiniest room,
Cells divide with gentle gloom,
A tiny world of wonder broom.

Their walls are strong and sturdy,
Protecting life inside, so hurry,
A secret world we can't be curly.

With DNA that's neat and tidy,
Cells work in perfect time and busy,
A dance of life and death, you see.

In every part of our body,
Cells are hard at work, no lazy,
Keeping us alive and free to be.
