Of course! Here is a poem about nature in four stanzas of four lines each:

In the forest, green and deep,
Where trees their vigil keep.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And in the streams, they babble free.

In fields of gold, so bright and wide,
The sun shines warm, the breeze does guide.
The flowers bloom, their colors bold,
And in the air, a scent is told.

On mountains high, where peaks do stand,
The wind howls strong, the rocks do hand.
The snow falls soft, the ice does grip,
And in the valleys, life does rip.

In deserts hot, where sand doth lie,
The sun beats down, the wind doth cry.
The cactus grows, its spines so sharp,
And in the oasis, life does start.
