Of course! Here is a short poem about a supermarket in two stanzas:

In the supermarket, shelves reach high
With food and drinks, to satisfy the eye
From fresh fruits to canned goods on the go
A place where hunger is fed, you know

The cashier scans your items with a smile
As you pay and leave, feeling satisfied for a while
The supermarket's magic, it makes us feel
With groceries in hand, for a tasty appeal
