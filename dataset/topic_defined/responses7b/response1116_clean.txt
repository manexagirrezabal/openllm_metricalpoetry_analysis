The crack of the bat, a sweet refrain
As the ball flies through the evening rain
A home run, a dream come true
In this game of skill and magic anew

The pitcher's spin, a wicked art
As he throws with all his might and heart
The catcher's glove, a barrier to part
And the runner's feet, they take flight from the start

The field's fresh cut grass, a sight to see
Where heroes are born and legends be
Baseball's magic lasts for you and me
In this game of skill that shines so bright and free

The crowd's roar, a deafening sound
As fans cheer on their team with joy profound
Baseball's magic, a feeling all around
In this game of skill that will forever be found
