In the supermarket, a world of its own
With products and prices, stories to be known
From the bread aisle to the produce stand
A place where dreams are made, with food in hand

The cashier rings up your items with a smile
As you leave the store, feeling satisfied for a while
The supermarket's magic, it brings us joy
With groceries in hand, for a tasty employ
