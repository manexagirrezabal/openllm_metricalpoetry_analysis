Death's dark shadow looms,
A grim reminder of our doom.
The end of life's sweet tune,
A time for us to be gone.

In the land of eternal sleep,
We'll find our final rest.
Where dreams of life are sealed,
And all our cares are best.

Death's gentle touch doth claim,
The lives that earth does hold.
But in death's peaceful frame,
We'll find a soul to unfold.

In death's embrace we'll find,
A love that knows no end.
For though it takes us home,
Our spirits will transcend
