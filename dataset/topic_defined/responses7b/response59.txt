Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a journey that we embark on,
A path that winds and twists, but leads to your heart.
It's the laughter we share, the memories we make,
The comfort of knowing our love will never fade.

In your eyes, I see a light, a shining star,
A love so true, it reaches far beyond who we are.
With you by my side, I know we'll face whatever lies ahead,
Our love will forever be the rhythm that fills our hearts with joy and love instead
