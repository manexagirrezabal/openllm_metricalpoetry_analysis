Of course! Here is a short poem with 7 lines about cells:

Inside each of us, a world so small
Cells divide and multiply with might and all
Organs built from them, our body's strength
Each one a tiny realm, life's great length
Working together, they keep us alive
A microscopic universe within, where life thrives
