In the forest dark, where shadows play,
The creatures roam, in endless array.
Their voices echo, through the trees so grand,
As nature's music fills the land.

In the gardens bloom, so fair and bright,
The flowers dance, in delight.
Their colors shine, like jewels in sight,
As nature's beauty takes flight.

In the sky so high, where clouds drift by,
The sun shines down, with gentle sigh.
Its rays so warm, on our faces so bright,
As nature's beauty brings us to delight
