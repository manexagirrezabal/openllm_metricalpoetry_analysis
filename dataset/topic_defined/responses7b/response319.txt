Of course, here is a poem about death in two stanzas:

Death, the great unknown, so dark and deep,
A journey we'll take, when our time has come to sleep.
It brings an end to life's short span,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been, if only we had a plan.

In death, we find peace from life's strife,
A quiet rest after a world full of strive.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and joy remain
