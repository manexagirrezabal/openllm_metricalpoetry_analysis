Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas about nature:

In the forest, green and deep,
Where trees their vigil keep.
The birds sing sweet their song,
And wildflowers bloom all day long.

In the field, the wind does play,
With wild grasses swaying gray.
The sun shines bright, the day is warm,
And nature's beauty is no alarm.
