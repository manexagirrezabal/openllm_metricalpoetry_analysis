Certainly! Here is a short poem with 7 lines about cells:

Microscopic world within, so small and bright
Cells divide and multiply with all their might
Organs made of them, our body's frame
Each one a tiny room with life's great game
Working together, they keep us alive
A universe inside, where magic thrives
