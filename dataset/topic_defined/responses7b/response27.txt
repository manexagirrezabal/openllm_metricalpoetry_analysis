Of course! Here is a short poem about love in 8 lines:

Love is a gift that we give and receive,
A feeling that makes our hearts conceive.
It's the way we feel when we're close to you,
The joy and happiness that love brings true.
With every kiss and every hug,
Love makes our hearts feel snug and tight
