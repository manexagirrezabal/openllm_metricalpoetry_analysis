Of course! Here is a short poem about baseball with 7 lines:

The game of baseball, a test of skill
A swing and a hit, the crowd's thrill
The pitcher throws, the batter swings with might
A home run soars, and the crowd takes flight
The sun sets slow, the night descends
Fans cheer on their team until the end.
