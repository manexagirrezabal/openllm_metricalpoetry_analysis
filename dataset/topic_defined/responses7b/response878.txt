Of course! Here is a poem with the specifications you provided:

In every living thing, a cell resides
A tiny unit, but oh so wide
From plants to animals, it's always there
A building block of life, beyond compare

Within each cell, a world unfolds
Where life's processes are told
From growth to reproduction, it's all the same
A miracle of nature, a cell is the frame

As cells divide and multiply with grace
The body's needs are met with pace
A marvel of nature, pure and true
A cell is the foundation, anew
