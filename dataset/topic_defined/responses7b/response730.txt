Of course! Here is a poem about the passing of time in four stanzas with three lines each:

Years pass by like sand in an hourglass,
Time's fleeting nature on full display.
Memories made, moments shared, and lives lived,
But still, the clock ticks on, and we age.

Summer sunshine bright, winter's chill embrace,
Seasons come and go, a constant pace.
Birthdays mark our journey, growth in every stage,
A lifetime of experiences, a tale to be told.

Springtime blooms with hope, summer's heat,
Autumn's hues, a season to retreat.
Winter's snow and ice, a time for rest,
Nature's rhythm, ever-changing guest.

Summer days are long, winter nights are short,
A cycle of life, forever to be sought.
Years go by like minutes, moments slipped away,
Time's mysterious ways, we can never stay.
