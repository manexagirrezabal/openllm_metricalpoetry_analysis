Inside the body's tiniest room,
Cells divide with gentle hum,
A tiny world of wonder broom.

Their walls are strong and sturdy, no sway,
Protecting life inside, day by day,
A secret world we can't stay away.

With DNA that's neat and tidy, no fray,
Cells work in perfect time, every day,
A dance of life and death, you see.

In every part of our body, no gray,
Cells are hard at work, day after day,
Keeping us alive and free to play.
