The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh,
A beauty that can't die.

The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight,
A wonder of the night.

The world is dark and quiet too,
The moon, a silver light that shines anew,
A beacon in the blue.

In this moment, I am free,
A feeling that's both wild and carefree,
A joy that's meant to be.
