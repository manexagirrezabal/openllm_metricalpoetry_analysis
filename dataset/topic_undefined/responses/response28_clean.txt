The snowflakes fall, a gentle touch,
A blanket of white, so soft and such.
The trees stand bare, their branches stark,
A winter's landscape, a natural mark.
The wind it howls, a mournful sound,
A symphony of cold, a lonely round.
The world is quiet, save the crunch,
Of snow beneath my feet, a rhythmic punch.
