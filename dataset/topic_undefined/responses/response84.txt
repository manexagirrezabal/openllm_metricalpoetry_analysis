The mountain peaks touch the sky,
A rugged beauty that makes me sigh,
A wonder that takes my breath.

The air is crisp and clean,
A freshness that's both cool and keen,
A feeling that's supreme.

The trails wind up high,
A journey that's both rough and nigh,
A challenge that's divine.

In this moment, I am alive,
A feeling that's both vibrant and rife,
A joy that I can't deny.[INSTS
