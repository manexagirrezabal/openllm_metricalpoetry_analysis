The flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
A colorful tapestry that entices,
Their sweet fragrance fills the air,
Inviting all to stop and stare.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 2 stanzas?]  Sure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas:

The sun sets slowly in the sky,
A fiery ball of orange and red,
The stars come out one by one,
As night falls overhead.

The world is quiet, save the sound,
Of crickets chirping in the ground,
Their gentle melody floats through the air,
A lullaby to soothe my prayer.
