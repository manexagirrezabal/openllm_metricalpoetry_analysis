Sure, here's a short poem with 2 stanzas:

In the morning light, the dew,
A sparkling gem that's fresh and new.
The grass is green and soft beneath,
A carpet that invites me to stretch.

The birds sing sweet and clear,
Their melodies so full of cheer.
The breeze is cool and rustles through,
A gentle touch that calms the spirit too.
