In the stillness of the night,
The stars shone with all their might.
Their twinkle reached far and wide,
And lit up the world with delight.

The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Cast shadows that danced with the night.
The world was bathed in a soft, pure light,
That filled the heart with peace and right.

The stars and moon, a celestial sight,
A wonder that filled the heart with light.
In the stillness of the night,
The universe showed its beauty bright.

In the silence of the night,
The stars and moon spoke with all their might.
Their message was one of love and peace,
A reminder to cease our ceaseless quest.
