In the ocean's depths, a world unseen,
Creatures lurk, both strange and keen.
The coral reef, a colorful sight,
A beauty that takes my breath away tonight.
The fish they swim, a graceful glide,
A symphony that can't be denied.
The sea turtles, they move with ease,
A gentle pace, that brings me to my knees.
The waves they crash, a roaring sound,
A natural force, that's never found.
The ocean it's vast and deep,
A mystery that we'll never keep.
The salty breeze, it fills the air,
A refreshing scent, that's beyond compare.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 14 lines, about the forest?]  Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines, about the forest:

The trees they stand, a towering sight,
A natural beauty, that's always in sight.
The leaves they rustle, a gentle sound,
A symphony that's never found.
The forest floor, a carpet soft,
A bed of pine, that's oh so aloft.
The creatures they roam, a wild delight,
A treasure trove, that's always in sight.
The trees they sway, a gentle dance,
A beauty that takes my breath, and makes me prance.
The forest air, a scent so sweet,
A fragrance that can't be beat.
The sun it shines, a golden glow,
A warm embrace, that makes me grow.
The forest it's peaceful, a place to hide,
A sanctuary, where I can reside.
