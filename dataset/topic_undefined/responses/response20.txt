The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight.
The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A lullaby that lasts all night long.
The moon is full, a silver glow,
A beacon in the darkness, don't you know.
