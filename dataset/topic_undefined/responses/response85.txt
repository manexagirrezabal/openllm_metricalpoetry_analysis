The desert sunsets paint the sky,
A palette of colors that take my eye,
A beauty that can't die.

The dunes stretch far and wide,
A landscape that's both harsh and pride,
A majesty that's grand.

The stars twinkle bright and near,
A celestial show that banishes all fear,
A wonder that's quite clear.

In this moment, I am free,
A feeling that's both wild and carefree,
A joy that's meant to be.[INSTS
