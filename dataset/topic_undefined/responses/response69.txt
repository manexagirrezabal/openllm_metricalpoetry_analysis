The night is a sanctuary, a place of peace,
A time to let my spirit find release.
The stars are the guardians, shining bright and clear,
A celestial watch that keeps my fears at bay, my dear.

The crickets chirp their lullaby, a soothing song,
A melody that brings me peaceful sleep all night long.
The breeze whispers through the trees, a gentle hush,
A calming presence that makes my heart feel rush.

The moon is full, a beacon in the sky,
Guiding me through the darkness, never shy.
The shadows dance upon the wall, a silhouette,
A story told in movement, graceful and neat.

In the night's embrace, I find my solace,
A time to let my spirit find its refuge and space.
The world may be dark, but not unkind,
A place where dreams and magic align, all mine to find.
