In the depths of the ocean so blue,
Creatures lurk, both old and new.
The coral reef, a colorful sight,
A beauty that takes my breath away tonight.
The fish they swim, a graceful glide,
A symphony that can't be denied.
The sea turtles, they move with ease,
A gentle pace, that brings me to my knees.
The waves they crash, a roaring sound,
A natural force, that's never found.
The ocean it's vast and deep,
A mystery that we'll never keep.
The salty breeze, it fills the air,
A refreshing scent, that's beyond compare.
