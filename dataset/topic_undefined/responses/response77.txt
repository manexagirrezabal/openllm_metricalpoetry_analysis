The stars twinkled bright in the midnight sky,
A celestial show, oh so high.
Their light reached far and wide,
Illuminating the world with delight.

The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Cast shadows that danced with the night.
The world was bathed in a soft, pure light,
That filled the heart with peace and right.

In the stillness of the night,
The stars and moon spoke with all their might.
Their message was one of love and peace,
A reminder to cease our ceaseless quest.

The universe showed its beauty bright,
A wonder that filled the heart with light.
In the silence of the night,
The stars and moon shone with all their might.
