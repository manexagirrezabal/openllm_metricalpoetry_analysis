The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight.
The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Illuminates the night with all its might.
The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A soothing melody that lasts all night long.
The breeze is cool and rustles through the trees,
A gentle caress that brings me to my knees.
The scent of blooming flowers fills the air,
A fragrance sweet that's beyond compare.
The night is peaceful, calm, and still,
A time for rest and peaceful thrill.
