The forest whispers, leaves rustle and sway,
A gentle breeze, a peaceful day.
The trees stand tall, their branches high,
A canopy, a shelter from the sky.
The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight,
A vibrant beauty, pure delight.
The forest creatures sing their song,
A chorus that's been sung so long.[INST: Can you please write me a poem with 14 lines?]  Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines:

The forest whispers, leaves rustle and sway,
A gentle breeze, a peaceful day.
The trees stand tall, their branches high,
A canopy, a shelter from the sky.
The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight,
A vibrant beauty, pure delight.
The forest creatures sing their song,
A chorus that's been sung so long.
The sun shines down, its warm rays,
Bringing life to all, in endless ways.
The forest floor, a carpet soft,
A haven for the weary aloft.
The trees stand guard, a watchful eye,
A sanctuary, for those who sigh.
