The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A palette of colors that takes my breath away.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight.

The world is dark and quiet too,
The only sound is the crickets' chirp-chirp-chew.
The moon's a glowing crescent shape,
A beacon in the darkness, a guiding cape.
