Sure, here's a short poem with 2 stanzas:

In the stillness of the night,
The stars shone with all their might.
Their twinkle reached far and wide,
And lit up the world with delight.

The moon, a glowing orb of white,
Cast shadows that danced with the night.
The world was bathed in a soft, pure light,
That filled the heart with peace and right.
