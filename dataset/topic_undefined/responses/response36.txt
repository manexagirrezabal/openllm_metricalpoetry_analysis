The ocean's roar, it echoes through,
A sound that's both fierce and true.
The waves they crash, a force so strong,
A natural power, that can't be wrong.
The tides they rise, a gentle flow,
A movement that's both slow and low.
The moon it pulls, a celestial guide,
A beacon in the dark, it abides.
The stars they twinkle, a night sky's delight,
A canopy of light, that's such a sight.
The ocean's depths, a mystery so grand,
A treasure trove, that's yet to stand.
The creatures, they dance, a natural show,
A beauty that takes my breath, and makes me glow.
