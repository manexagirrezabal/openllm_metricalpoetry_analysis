The night is a canvas, painted black,
A blank slate for my imagination to attack.
The stars are the brushstrokes, delicate and fine,
A celestial masterpiece, all mine.

The crickets chirp their song, a soothing melody,
A lullaby that brings me peaceful sleep.
The breeze whispers through the trees, a gentle hush,
A calming presence that makes my heart rush.

The moon is full, a beacon in the sky,
Guiding me through the darkness, never shy.
The shadows dance upon the wall, a silhouette,
A story told in movement, graceful and neat.

In the night's embrace, I find my solace,
A time to let my spirit find its refuge.
The world may be dark, but not unkind,
A place where dreams and magic align, all mine.
