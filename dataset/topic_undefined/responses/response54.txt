Sure, here's a short poem with 2 stanzas:

In the quiet of the night,
The stars shine with all their might.
Their twinkle reaches far and wide,
And fills my heart with delight.

The world is dark and still,
The only sound is the crickets' thrill.
The moon's a glowing orb of white,
A beacon in the darkness, a guiding light.
