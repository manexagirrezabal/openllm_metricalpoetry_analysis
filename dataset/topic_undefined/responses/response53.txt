Sure, here's a short poem with 2 stanzas:

The waves crash on the shore,
A soothing sound that calms the soul.
The seagulls cry out in the distance,
A haunting melody that makes me whole.

The sun sets low and paints the sky,
A palette of colors that takes my breath away.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight.
