In the stillness of the night,
I feel my heart take flight.
The stars up above, so bright and clear,
A celestial show, without fear.
The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A melody that lasts all night long.
The breeze is cool, a gentle caress,
That brings me peace, and takes my stress.
The scent of blooming flowers fills the air,
A fragrance sweet, beyond compare.
The night is calm, a time for rest,
A moment to find inner peace, and be blessed.
