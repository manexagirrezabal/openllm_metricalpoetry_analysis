The snowflakes fall, a gentle touch,
A blanket of white, so soft and such.
The trees stand tall, their branches bare,
A winter's landscape, so eerie and fair.
The wind it howls, a mournful sound,
As if it's lost and cannot be found.
The world is quiet, save the crunch,
Of snow beneath my feet, a symphony of lunch.
