The night is a symphony, a song so pure,
A melody that fills my heart with sure.
The stars are the notes, shining bright and clear,
A celestial concert, all mine to hear.

The crickets chirp their rhythm, a beat so steady,
A lullaby that brings me peaceful sleep.
The breeze whispers through the trees, a gentle sway,
A calming presence that makes my heart stay.

The moon is full, a beacon in the sky,
Guiding me through the darkness, never shy.
The shadows dance upon the wall, a silhouette,
A story told in movement, graceful and neat.

In the night's embrace, I find my solace,
A time to let my spirit find its refuge.
The world may be dark, but not unkind,
A place where dreams and magic align, all mine.
