The waves crash on the shore,
A symphony that's evermore,
A sound that I adore.

The ocean breeze is cool and fresh,
A feeling that's both calming and blessed,
A gift from the sea's embrace.

The sand is hot beneath my feet,
A reminder of the sun's sweet treat,
A sensation that can't be beat.

In this moment, I am alive,
A feeling that's both vibrant and rife,
A joy that I can't deny.[INSTS]
