The sunflowers stand, a tall, proud stance,
A field of gold, a natural dance.
The bees they buzz, a busy throng,
A summer's day, a joyous song.
The breeze it blows, a gentle touch,
A soothing caress, a loving cradle's clutch.
The flowers they sway, a delicate grace,
A natural beauty, a true embrace.
