The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A night of rest, a peaceful sight.
The moon, a glowing crescent smile,
Lights up the darkness, all the while.
The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A lullaby that lasts all night long.
