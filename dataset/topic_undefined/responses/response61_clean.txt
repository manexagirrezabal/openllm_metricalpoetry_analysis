The night is young and full of cheer,
A time for dreams and hopes to clear.
The stars up high, they twinkle bright,
A celestial show that's such a sight.

The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A soothing melody that lasts all night long.
The breeze is cool and rustles through the trees,
A gentle caress that brings me to my knees.

The moon is full and casts its light,
A beacon in the darkness of the night.
The shadows dance upon the wall,
A silhouette that tells a story tall.

The night air smells of blooming flowers,
A sweet perfume that fills my hours.
The world is dark, but not unkind,
A place where dreams and magic align.
