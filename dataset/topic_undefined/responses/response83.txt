The forest is alive tonight,
A chorus of creatures that take flight,
A symphony of delight.

The trees stand tall and strong,
A shelter from the world's wild song,
A haven where I belong.

The stars twinkle through the leaves,
A celestial show that grants my wishes,
A magic that relieves.

In this moment, I am free,
A feeling that's both wild and carefree,
A joy that's meant to be.[INSTS
