The ocean waves, they rise and fall,
A never-ending call.
The tides, they come and go,
A natural rhythm, that we know.
The moon, it pulls, a gentle force,
A celestial dance, of course.
The stars, they twinkle bright,
A night sky, a heavenly sight.
The ocean it's vast and deep,
A mystery that we'll never keep.
The creatures, they lurk and play,
A natural wonder, in every way.
The coral reef, a colorful sight,
A beauty that takes my breath away tonight.
