In the morning light, the birds take flight,
Their songs so sweet and full of delight.
The breeze is cool and rustles through the trees,
A gentle melody that carries on the breeze.

The flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
A colorful display that's nothing short of views.
Their fragrance fills the air and calms the mind,
A sensory treat that's simply divine.
