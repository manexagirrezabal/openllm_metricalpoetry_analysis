In the morning light, I see,
A world full of glee.
The birds they sing, a chorus sweet,
A symphony that can't be beat.
The sun it rises, a golden glow,
A new beginning, as the day unfolds.
The breeze it whispers, through the trees,
A gentle melody, that carries on the breeze.
The flowers they bloom, a colorful sight,
A beauty that takes my breath away tonight.
The world it's full of life and cheer,
A place to find solace, free from fear.[INST: Can you write me a poem with 14 lines, about the ocean?]  Sure, here is a poem with 14 lines, about the ocean:

The ocean waves crash on the shore,
A soothing sound that I adore.
The salty breeze fills the air,
A refreshing scent that's beyond compare.
The sun it shines, a golden glow,
A warm embrace that makes me grow.
The sea creatures they dance and play,
A natural beauty, in every way.
The ocean it's vast and deep,
A mystery that we'll never keep.
The waves they rise and fall,
A never-ending call.
The ocean it's full of life,
A treasure that's beyond strife.
