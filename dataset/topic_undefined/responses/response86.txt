The city lights shine bright,
A symphony of color in the night,
A beauty that's both bold and bright.

The streets are alive with sound,
A cacophony that's both loud and proud,
A energy that's always found.

The people rush by with haste,
A river of humanity that never finds rest,
A movement that's both fast and vast.

In this moment, I am part,
A feeling that's both wild and smart,
A joy that's in my heart.
