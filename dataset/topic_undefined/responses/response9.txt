The clouds drift, a lazy dance,
A gentle breeze, a soothing trance.
The world is quiet, a calm embrace,
A moment's peace, a time to trace.[INST: Can you do one more?]  Sure, here is another poem with 4 lines:

The moon glows bright, a silvery light,
A beacon in the dark of night.
The stars twinkle, a celestial show,
A universe that's full of glow.
