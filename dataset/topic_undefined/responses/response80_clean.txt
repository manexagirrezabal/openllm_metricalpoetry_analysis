In the stillness of the night,
The stars shone with all their might,
A canopy of light.

The world was hushed and still,
The moon, a silver thrill,
A beacon on the hill.

The wind it whispered low,
Of secrets yet untold,
A mystery to know.

In this moment, pure and true,
I felt my heart anew,
A love that's old and new.
