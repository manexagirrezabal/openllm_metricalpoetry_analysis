The river flows with gentle grace,
A movement that's both calm and embraced,
A beauty that's both vast and placed.

The banks are lined with green,
A verdant path that's both serene and seen,
A peacefulness that's supreme.

The sun shines bright, a golden glow,
A warmth that's both inviting and aglow,
A joy that's meant to grow.

In this moment, I am free,
A feeling that's both wild and carefree,
A happiness that's meant to be.[INSTS
