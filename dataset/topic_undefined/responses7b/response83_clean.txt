In the stillness of the night,
The stars shine with all their might.
Their twinkle reaches far and wide,
And fills my heart with delight.

The world outside may be wild,
But in here, I am mild.
The silence is a balm to soothe,
And calm the raging storm inside.

In the morning light, I see
A new day full of possibility.
The sunrise brings hope anew,
And fills my heart with courage too.

The world may be untamed and rough,
But in here, I find my refuge tough.
I am safe from all life's strife,
And can face each day with new life.
