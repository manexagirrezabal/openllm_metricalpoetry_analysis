The flowers bloom, and color the air,
A sweet fragrance that's beyond compare.
The bees buzz, and collect their nectar,
A busy scene, a moment to savor.

I sit and watch, and feel so at peace,
In this garden, my soul finds release.
The beauty of nature, it brings me joy,
A moment's delight, a hearty employ
