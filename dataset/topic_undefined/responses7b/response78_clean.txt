In the silence, I find my peace,
A quiet place where love release.
The world outside may be loud and wild,
But in here, all is calm and mild.

With every breath, I feel your heart beat strong,
Our love a flame that burns all day long.
Through every moment, our love shines bright,
A beacon in the darkness of night.

The world may try to tear us apart,
But our love is strong, a work of art.
Together we'll weather every storm and strife,
And in each other, find eternal life.

So let us cherish every single day,
And fill our hearts with love in every way
