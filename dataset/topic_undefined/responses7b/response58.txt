Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas:

In the gentle breeze, I feel your touch,
A caress that soothes my soul's such.
The flowers sway, like lovers in embrace,
And I am filled with love's sweet grace.

With every moment, our love grows strong,
A bond that's unbreakable, all day long.
In your eyes, I see a shining light,
A beacon that guides me through the night
