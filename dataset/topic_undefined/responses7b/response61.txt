Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas:

The world outside my window is gray
A somber mood, a dismal day
But in my heart, a fire burns bright
A passion for life, a love so tight

In the depths of winter's chill
My spirit soars, my heart does thrill
For in the cold, I find my peace
A solace that my soul can seize

The trees stand bare, their limbs outstretched
A skeletal crew, a grim procession led
But in their branches, I see beauty rare
A winter's tale, a story to share

In the softness of a snowfall's embrace
I find a solace that can never fade away
For in the quiet, I am at peace
A tranquility that my soul does release
