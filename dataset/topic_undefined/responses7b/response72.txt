Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 4 lines each:

In the stillness, I find my peace,
A quiet place where love releases.
The world outside may be loud and wild,
But in here, all is calm and mild.

With every breath, I feel your love,
A gentle touch that comes from above.
It fills my heart and makes me whole,
A love that's pure and never grows old.

In this moment, I am yours alone,
Forever loved, forever known.
Together we share this love so true,
A bond that will forever see us through.

So let us cherish every single day,
And fill our hearts with love in every way.
