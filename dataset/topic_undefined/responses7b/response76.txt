Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 4 lines each:

The moon glows bright, a silver light,
Illuminating the night with all its might.
I think of you and feel my heart soar,
Together we dance in love's sweet score.

In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of my heart's deep hue.
With every kiss, our love shines brighter,
A flame that burns bright, forever and ever.

The world may try to tear us apart,
But our love is strong, a work of art.
Through every storm, through every strife,
Our love will endure, a love that's alive.

So let us hold on to what we have found,
And cherish every moment, every sound
