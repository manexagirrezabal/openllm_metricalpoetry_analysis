In the ocean's depths, I find my peace,
A world beyond the reach of cease.
The waves and tides, they know no fight,
And in their embrace, I take flight.

The stars above, they twinkle bright,
A celestial show, a wondrous sight.
In their radiance, I find my way,
To a place where love will stay.

In the forest's heart, I hear the call,
Of creatures great and small.
The trees and flowers, they stand tall,
And in their beauty, I am enthralled.

In the mountains high, I find my home,
Where wind and snow, they roam.
The peaks and valleys, they know no bounds,
And in their grandeur, I am found.
