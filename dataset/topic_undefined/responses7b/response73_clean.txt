The stars shone bright in the midnight sky,
As I thought of you and why I lie.
Your smile, your laugh, your eyes so blue,
My heart beats fast, my love for you true.

In the morning light, I wake with ease,
Thinking of you, my heart at peace.
The world outside may seem cold and harsh,
But with you, my dear, I am never scarred.

Through each day, my love for you grows strong,
A flame that burns bright, all day long.
In your arms, I find my safe haven,
With you, my heart is forever given.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And never let our love go cold or spare.
