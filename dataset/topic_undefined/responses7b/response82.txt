Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines:

In the morning light, I see
A world full of beauty and glee.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And I am filled with joy and ease.

The sun shines bright and warm on my face,
Bringing life and energy to the place.
I breathe in deeply, feeling alive,
Grateful for this day and all it gives.

In the evening, when the day is done,
I look up at the stars and have fun.
They twinkle and shine with a gentle glow,
A night of peace, and a world aglow.

The world is full of magic and wonder,
A place where dreams and hope are plunder.
So let us cherish each moment we share,
And fill our hearts with love and care.
