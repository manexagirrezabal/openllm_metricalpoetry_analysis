In the starlight, I see your face,
A vision of beauty, in this place.
Your smile shines bright, like the moon so high,
And my heart beats fast, with love's sweet sigh.

With every kiss, our love grows strong,
A bond that's unbreakable, all day long.
In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
Where love and joy fill every space
