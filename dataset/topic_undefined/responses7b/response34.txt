Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines:

The snow falls soft and quiet on the ground,
A gentle blanket that touches the sound.
The trees stand still, their branches bare,
A winter's peace, a time so fair.

I step outside, and feel the chill,
A moment's calm, a sense of thrill.
The snowflakes dance, and twirl with glee,
A winter wonderland, for me to see
