Of course! Here is a poem with 3 stanzas of 4 lines each, followed by a final two-line stanza:

In the morning light, I see
A world full of beauty and glee.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And my heart feels alive with ease.

In the afternoon, I feel
A sense of peace that's hard to conceal.
The sun shines bright, without a flaw,
And I am grateful for this time I draw.

At night, when all is still and quiet,
I see the stars shining with such elation.
Their twinkle reaches far and wide,
Bringing joy to my heart and soul inside.
