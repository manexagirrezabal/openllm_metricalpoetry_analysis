In the morning's golden light,
The world awakens with delight.
Birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And joyful memories fill my breeze.

In the afternoon's warmth and grace,
Nature's beauty takes its place.
Sunshine bright, without a flaw,
Bringing peace to all I draw.

At night's stillness and quiet heart,
Stars twinkle with elation's start.
Reaching far and wide with glee,
Their beauty brings joy to me and thee.
