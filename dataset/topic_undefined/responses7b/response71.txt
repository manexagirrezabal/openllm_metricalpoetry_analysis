Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 4 lines each:

Rays of sunshine, bright and bold,
Bring joy to my heart, young and old.
Dancing on the dew-kissed grass,
A symphony of life at last.

In the morning's gentle light,
I wake with hope, a new sight.
The world outside is full of grace,
A place where love finds its space.

Softly whispers the breeze in my ear,
"Love is the answer, always near."
I close my eyes and feel it deep inside,
A peace that only love can provide.

In this world of wonder, I find my place,
With love as my guide, I'll find my space.
Wherever life may take me far and wide,
Love will always be by my side.
