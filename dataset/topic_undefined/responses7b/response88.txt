Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines:

In the morning light, I see
A world full of beauty and glee.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And I am filled with joy and ease.

In the quiet moments, I find my peace,
A time to heal and release.
The world outside may be loud and wild,
But in here, I am mild and calm and child.

In the arms of a loved one, I find my rest,
A place where heart and soul are blessed.
The world may be untamed and rough,
But in here, I am safe and enough.

In the beauty of nature, I find my home,
Where love and laughter are never alone.
