Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas:

In the morning's golden light
The world awakens, new and bright
A time for dreams, a time for flight
When all things are possible in sight

The birds they sing, their melodies so clear
A chorus of joy, a symphony to hear
Nature's concert, a treat so pure
A morning's magic, a gift to endure

In the evening's soft embrace
The world slows down, a peaceful place
The stars they twinkle, a celestial show
A night of wonder, a time to know

In the stillness of the night
I find my peace, a gentle light
A time for reflection, a time to unite
When all is calm, and all is right
