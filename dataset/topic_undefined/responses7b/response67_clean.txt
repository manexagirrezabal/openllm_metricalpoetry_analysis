In the depths of winter's chill
I find a solace that is still
A time for contemplation, a time to unwind
When all around me, life resigns

The trees stand bare, their limbs outstretched
A skeletal crew, a grim procession led
But in their branches, I see beauty rare
A winter's tale, a story to share

In the softness of a snowfall's embrace
I find a peace that never fades away
For in the quiet, I am at ease
A tranquility that my soul does release

So let me bask in winter's grace
And find my joy, in every place
