Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas, each with 3 lines:

Rays of sunshine bright and bold,
Bringing warmth to my heart of gold.
A smile so wide, it lights the way,
To brighter days, come what may.

Softly falls the rain tonight,
Washing away my sorrow's plight.
A gentle touch, a comforting embrace,
Bringing peace to this troubled place.

The wind it howls and whistles by,
Carrying secrets of the sky.
A mystery so deep and wide,
A tale that only nature can provide.

In dreams I dance with joyful grace,
Free from the weight of life's embrace.
A refuge from the world outside,
Where I can be myself, without disguise.
