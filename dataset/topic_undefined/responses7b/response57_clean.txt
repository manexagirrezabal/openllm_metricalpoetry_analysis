In the quiet hours of dawn,
I find my peace, when the world is gone.
The mist rises, like a dream so bright,
And I feel the love, that's always in sight.

With every breath, I feel you near,
A love that's pure, and true, and clear.
In your embrace, I find my home,
Where love and joy are forever known
