Of course! Here is a poem with 2 stanzas:

In the forest's embrace, I find my home,
A world of magic, where I am never alone.
The trees lean in, to listen and share,
A tale of wonder, that's beyond compare.

With every step, I feel the earth move,
A gentle vibration, from deep within her groove.
It's a rhythm that's been here since time began,
A beat that's ancient, yet ever-new again
