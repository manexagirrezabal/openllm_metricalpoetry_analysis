Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas:

In the garden of life, I bloom and grow
A flower among the weeds, a radiant glow
My petals open wide, my colors bright
A sight to see, a pure delight

The world may be complex, it may be loud
But in my heart, a melody resounds
A symphony of love, a chorus of joy
A song that sings, a tale to employ

In the quiet moments, I find my peace
A time for reflection, a time to release
The burdens of the world, they fade away
And in their place, a brighter day

So let me bask in the sun's warm rays
And dance among the stars, in endless praise
