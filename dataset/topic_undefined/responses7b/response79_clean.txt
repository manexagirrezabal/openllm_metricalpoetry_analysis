In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A reflection of my heart's deep hue.
With every kiss, our love shines brighter,
A flame that burns bright, forever and ever.

The world may try to tear us apart,
But our love is strong, a work of art.
Together we'll weather every storm and strife,
And in each other, find eternal life.

In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
A sanctuary where love's gentle grace.
With every moment, our love will forever grow,
A bond that will forever be true and know.

So let us cherish every single day,
And fill our hearts with love in every way
