Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines:

The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A night of peace, a sight so right.

I step outside, and feel the breeze,
A gentle touch that brings me ease.
The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A lullaby that lasts all night long.
