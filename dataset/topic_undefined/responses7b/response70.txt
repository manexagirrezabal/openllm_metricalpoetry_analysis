Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas of 4 lines each:

In the morning light, I see
A world full of beauty and glee.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And my heart feels full of ease.

In the evening, when the sun sets low,
I feel a peace that only grows.
The stars come out to twinkle bright,
And I know everything is alright.

Through the days and nights, I find my way
To a place where love resides.
It's where my heart and soul connect,
And all is well, my dearest friend.

In this world of ours, so full of strife,
I find solace in the beauty of life.
The love we share, it makes us strong,
And carries us through till dawn's early light.
