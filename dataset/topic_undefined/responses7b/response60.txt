Of course, I'd be happy to! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas:

In the stillness of the night
The stars shine with all their might
Their twinkling light, so pure and bright
Fills my heart with joy and delight

In the morning's golden glow
The sun rises slow and low
Bringing life and energy to all
A new day dawns, and I stand tall

In the rain's gentle patter
I hear a soothing melody
Nature's symphony, a treat
Fills my soul with peace and glee

In the autumn's fiery hue
The leaves dance in the breeze anew
A kaleidoscope of color bright
A wondrous sight, a pure delight
