Of course! Here is another short poem with 14 lines:

The library is quiet, and full of books,
A treasure trove, that I adore.
The shelves are stacked, and filled with knowledge,
A source of learning, for my heart's devotion.

I sit and read, and let the words take flight,
A journey through the pages, a wondrous sight.
In this place, I find my solace strong,
And the joy of reading, all day long
