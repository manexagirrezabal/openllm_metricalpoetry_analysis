In the depths of my heart, a fire burns bright
A passion for life, a love so tight
Through every trial and every test
I'll find my strength, I'll do my best

The world may be harsh, it may be cold
But in my spirit, a flame is unfold
A light that shines, a beacon of hope
A guiding force, when the road gets rough

In the quiet moments, I find my peace
A time for reflection, a time to release
The burdens of the world, they fade away
And in their place, a brighter day

So let me embrace this life with grace
And find my joy, in every place
