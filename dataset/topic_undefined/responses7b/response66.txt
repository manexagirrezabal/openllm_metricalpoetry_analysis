Of course! Here is a poem with 4 stanzas:

In the realm of dreams, I soar and glide
A freedom bird, my spirit inside
I dance among the clouds, I ride the wind
A journey through the skies, my heart and mind

The world may be harsh, it may be cold
But in my imagination, a fire is told
A tale of wonder, a story to share
A dreamworld where I am beyond compare

In the quiet moments, I find my peace
A time for reflection, a time to release
The burdens of the world, they fade away
And in their place, a brighter day

So let me keep my dreams alive and strong
And find my joy, in every song
