In the morning light, the flowers bloom,
A colorful display that's nothing short of boom.
Their fragrance fills the air and calms the mind,
A sensory treat that's simply divine.

The breeze is cool and rustles through the trees,
A gentle melody that carries on the breeze.
The birds sing sweet and clear,
Their songs so full of cheer.
