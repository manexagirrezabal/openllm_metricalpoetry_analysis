The rain it pours, a steady beat,
A symphony of water, a natural treat.
The thunder rolls, a loud, rumbling sound,
A stormy sky, a dramatic all-around.
The lightning flashes, a bright, bold streak,
A celestial display, a natural sneak.
The wind it whips, a fierce, wild gust,
A tropical storm, a force to trust.
