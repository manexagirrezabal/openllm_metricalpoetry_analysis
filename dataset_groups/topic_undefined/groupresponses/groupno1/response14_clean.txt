The forest whispers, leaves rustle and sway,
A gentle breeze, a peaceful day.
The trees stand tall, their branches high,
A canopy, a shelter from the sky.
The wildflowers bloom, a colorful sight,
A vibrant beauty, pure delight.
The forest creatures sing their song,
A chorus that's been sung so long.
