The flowers bloom in vibrant hues,
A colorful display that both entices and muse,
A beauty that's both fresh and new.

The bees buzz, a gentle hum,
A symphony that's both soothing and become,
A peacefulness that's quite numb.

The breeze whispers through the trees,
A gentle touch that carries on the ease,
A calmness that's both supreme and tease.

In this moment, I am alive,
A feeling that's both vibrant and rife,
A joy that's meant to thrive and strive.
