The snowflakes fall like diamonds in the sky,
A gentle touch that makes me want to fly,
A beauty that can't be denied.

The world is quiet, still and cold,
A peacefulness that takes my breath, a story unfold,
A magic that's both old and bold.

The trees stand bare, their branches stretched,
A silhouette that's both stark and etched,
A beauty that's both harsh and fetched.

In this moment, I am alive,
A feeling that's both vibrant and rife,
A joy that's meant to thrive.
