The world outside my window pane,
A canvas painted by the rain.
The droplets fall, a rhythmic beat,
A symphony that can't be beat.
The leaves, they sway and dance with grace,
A natural beauty, full of charm and space.
The breeze, it whispers through the trees,
A gentle lullaby, a melody that tease.
The clouds, they float, a cotton candy sky,
A sweet delight, that catches my eye.
The sun, it peeks, a golden glow,
A warm embrace, that makes me grow.
The world, it's full of life and cheer,
A place to find solace, free from fear.
