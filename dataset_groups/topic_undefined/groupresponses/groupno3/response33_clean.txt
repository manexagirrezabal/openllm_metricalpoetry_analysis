In the morning light, I see,
A world full of glee.
The birds they sing, a chorus sweet,
A symphony that can't be beat.
The sun it rises, a golden glow,
A new beginning, as the day unfolds.
The breeze it whispers, through the trees,
A gentle melody, that carries on the breeze.
The flowers they bloom, a colorful sight,
A beauty that takes my breath away tonight.
The world it's full of life and cheer,
A place to find solace, free from fear.
