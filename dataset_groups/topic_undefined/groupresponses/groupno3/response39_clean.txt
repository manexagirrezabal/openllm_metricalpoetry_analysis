The forest is a place of peace,
Where nature's wonders never cease.
The trees they stand, a towering height,
A natural beauty, that takes my breath away tonight.
The leaves they rustle, a gentle breeze,
A melody that brings me to my knees.
The forest floor, a carpet soft and green,
A bed of pine, that's oh so clean.
The creatures they roam, a wild delight,
A treasure trove, that's always in sight.
The trees they sway, a gentle dance,
A beauty that takes my breath, and makes me prance.
The forest air, a scent so sweet and fresh,
A fragrance that can't be beat, it's truly the best.
The sun it shines, a golden glow,
A warm embrace, that makes me grow and feel alive.
