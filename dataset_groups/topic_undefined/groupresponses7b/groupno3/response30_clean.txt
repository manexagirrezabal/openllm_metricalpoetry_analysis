The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out and twinkle bright,
A night of peace, a sight so right.

The world is quiet, save the crickets' song,
A lullaby that lasts all night long.
The breeze is warm and carries scents so sweet,
A night of rest, a dreamy treat.
