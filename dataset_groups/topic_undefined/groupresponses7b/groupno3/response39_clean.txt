The ocean waves crash, and wash away my fears,
A soothing sound, that brings me cheer.
The salty spray, it cleanses me of all my tears,
And in this moment, I am free from all my years.

I stand at shore, and watch the sun set fast,
A peaceful scene, a moment to forever last.
In this place, I find my soul's truest rest,
And a sense of calm, that will forever be blessed
