In the stillness of the night,
The stars shine with all their might.
Their twinkle reaches far and wide,
And fills my heart with delight.

In the morning light, I see
A world full of beauty and glee.
The birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And I am filled with joy and ease.

In the evening, when the day is done,
I look up at the stars and have fun.
They twinkle and shine with a gentle glow,
A night of peace, and a world aglow.

In the quiet moments, I find my peace,
A time to heal and release.
The world outside may be loud and wild,
But in here, I am mild and calm and child.
