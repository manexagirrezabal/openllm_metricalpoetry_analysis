The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out, one by one,
A twinkling canvas, under the moon.

The sea, a vast expanse of blue,
Endless depths, a mystery anew.
The waves they crash, a soothing sound,
A symphony that echoes all around.

In autumn's hue, the trees stand tall,
A kaleidoscope of color, one and all.
The leaves they rustle, golden light,
A natural masterpiece, a wondrous sight.

The mountains rise, a towering form,
A challenge to the eye, a storm to storm.
Their peaks they touch the sky so high,
A rugged beauty, for the eye to fly.
