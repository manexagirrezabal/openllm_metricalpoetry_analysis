The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
I think of you and all we've been,
And how my heart belongs to only then.

In memories of laughter and of tears,
Our love shines bright, through all the years.
Through every moment, every smile and frown,
With you, my dear, I know I'll always be found.

The world may change, but our love remains,
A constant in a sea of insane.
Through every storm, through every strife,
Our love will endure, a love that's alive.

So let us hold on to what we have found,
And cherish every moment, every sound.
