In the morning light, I see your face,
A beauty that fills my heart with grace.
Your smile, your laugh, your eyes so bright,
Forever etched in my mind's delight.

With every breath, I feel our love grow strong,
A bond that will forever be right.
Through every moment, every joy and strife,
Our love will endure, a love that's full of life.

The world may change, but our love remains,
A constant in a sea of insane.
Through every storm, through every heartbeat,
Our love will forever be a sweet treat.

So let us cherish every moment we share,
And fill our hearts with love beyond compare
