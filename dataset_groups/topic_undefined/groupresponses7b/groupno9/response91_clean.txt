In the morning's golden light,
The world awakens with delight.
Birds sing sweetly in the trees,
And joyous memories fill my breeze.

In the afternoon's warmth,
Nature's beauty takes its worth.
Sunshine bright, without a flaw,
Bringing peace to all I draw.

At night's stillness and quietude,
Stars twinkle with elation's mood.
Reaching far and wide with glee,
Their beauty brings joy to me.
