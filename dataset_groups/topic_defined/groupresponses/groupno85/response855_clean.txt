A cell, a tiny, microscopic world,
A universe within a universe unfurled.
Within its walls, a story's told,
Of life, of growth, of cells that fold.

Its membrane, a thin barrier,
A gatekeeper, a protector, a guardian dear.
Through pores, a passage in,
For nutrients, a vital win to glean.

Inside, a fluid, rich and bright,
A cytoplasm, a world of delightful sight.
Organelles, like tiny stars,
Shining, playing their parts in the heart.

A nucleus, a central heart,
A control room, a work of art from the start.
Chromosomes, a twisted pair,
A code, a secret to share with care.
