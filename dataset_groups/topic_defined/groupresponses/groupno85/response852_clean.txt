A cell, a microscopic gem,
A tiny world, a universe within.
Within its walls, a story's told,
Of life, of growth, of cells that fold.

Its membrane, a thin barrier,
A gatekeeper, a protector, a guardian.
Through pores, a passage in,
For nutrients, a vital win.

Inside, a fluid, rich and bright,
A cytoplasm, a world of delight.
Organelles, like tiny stars,
Shining, playing their parts.

A nucleus, a central heart,
A control room, a work of art.
Chromosomes, a twisted pair,
A code, a secret to share.
