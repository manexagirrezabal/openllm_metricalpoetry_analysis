The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A home run hit, the crowd can't be beat.
The runner rounds the bases, a triumphant feat,
The fans erupt in cheers, they can't be seated.
The pitcher winds up, he's got the skill,
A strikeout pitch, the batter takes his pill.
The shortstop makes a play, a highlight reel,
The outfielders cheer, it's a great big deal.
The manager signals, a strategic move,
The runner takes, a base he can improve.
The umpire calls the strike, it's fair and square,
The game is tied, the tension's in the air.
