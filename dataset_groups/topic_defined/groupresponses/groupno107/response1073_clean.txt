The ballpark's alive, the energy's high,
The players are ready, they're ready to shine.
A pitching duel, a battle of might,
The fans are on edge, it's a thrilling sight.
The bases are loaded, the tension's in the air,
A grand slam home run, the crowd's beyond compare.
The shortstop makes a play, a highlight reel,
The outfielders cheer, it's a great big deal.
The manager signals, a strategic move,
The runner takes, a base he can improve.
The umpire calls the strike, it's fair and square,
The game is tied, the tension's in the air.
