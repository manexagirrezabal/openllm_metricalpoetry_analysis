The sun sets slow, the game's in full swing,
The players give their all, they're in the ring.
A double play, a sweet melody,
The fans are on their feet, they're in harmony.
The pitcher throws, a fireball intense,
The batter swings, a homer he makes sense.
The outfielders run, a race against time,
The runner scores, the crowd is in rhyme.
The manager signals, a plan so grand,
The players execute, they're taking a stand.
The umpire calls the play, it's fair and just,
The game is tied, the excitement's a must.
A bases-loaded walk, a tense moment,
The crowd is on edge, it's a thrilling event.
The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A home run hit, the crowd can't be beat.
