A year, a collection of days,
A journey of moments, a path we sway.
From sunrise to sunset, from dawn to night,
It's a cycle that brings us new light.

The seasons come and go, each one unique,
A time for growth, a time to seek.
The spring, a time of hope and cheer,
A season of renewal, a time to clear.

The summer, warm and long and bright,
A time for adventure, a time to take flight.
The autumn, with colors ablaze,
A harvest of memories, a time to amaze.

The winter, cold and crisp and clean,
A time for rest, a time serene.
A year, a gift so pure and true,
A journey of growth, a path anew.
