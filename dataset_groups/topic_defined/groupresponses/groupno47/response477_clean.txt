In the digital realm, they come and go,
A moment's thought, a digital flow,
Instance, a moment's glow.

With servers humming, code unfurls,
A fleeting dream, a digital whirl,
Instance, a moment's twirls.

A burst of compute, a flash of light,
A moment's glory, a digital sight,
Instance, a moment's might.

In the virtual world, they live and die,
Ephemeral, like snow in the sky,
Instance, a moment's sigh.
