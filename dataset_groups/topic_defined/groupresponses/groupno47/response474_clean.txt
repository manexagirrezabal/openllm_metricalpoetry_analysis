In the digital expanse, they shine,
A moment's thought, a digital shrine,
Instance, a moment's spine.

With code unfolding, dreams take flight,
A fleeting vision, a digital sight,
Instance, a moment's light.

A burst of compute, a flash of might,
A moment's glory, a digital delight,
Instance, a moment's bright.

In the virtual world, they live and die,
Ephemeral, like clouds in the sky,
Instance, a moment's sigh.
