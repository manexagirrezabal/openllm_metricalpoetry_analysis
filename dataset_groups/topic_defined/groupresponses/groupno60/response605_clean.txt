Attention, oh attention, a gift so rare
A moment's notice, a glance, a show of care
In this world of noise, it's hard to share

Our minds are busy, our thoughts astray
Attention's a treasure, hard to stay
But we yearn for it, day by day

The world spins on, its chaos reigns
We struggle to focus, to gain
A moment's peace, a chance to explain

But still we seek, we yearn and crave
That elusive thing, that moment of grace
When attention's paid, when we're not ignored, but loved.
