The mountains tower, a mighty sight,
A challenge to climb, a thrill so bright.
The snow-capped peaks, a winter's grace,
A scenic beauty, a place of pace.
The valleys below, a lush embrace,
A home for creatures, a peaceful space.
The wind whispers through, a gentle breeze,
Nature's melody, a symphony that teases.
