The sun shines bright, the field's alive,
Players gather, ready to thrive,
Baseball's magic, a joy to arrive.

The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A ball soaring through the sky, a treat to meet,
The roar of the crowd, a joyful beat.

The grassy field, a vibrant green,
Players clad in white, a pristine scene,
Bases loaded, the game's keen.

The pitcher winds up, a moment tense,
The batter swings, a shot immense,
A home run, the crowd erupts in sense.
