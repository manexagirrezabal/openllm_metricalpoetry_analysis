Attention, oh attention, a fragile thing
A moment's notice, a delicate wing
We give it to those who need it most
A child's cry, a lover's gentle boast

It's a gift we offer, a treasure we share
A connection that lifts us, beyond compare
In the world's noise, it's a refuge we find
A haven of calm, a peace of mind

Attention, oh attention, a treasure we earn
A moment's joy, a love that's truly learned
It's a bond that grows, a love that's true
A blessing that enriches, come what may.
