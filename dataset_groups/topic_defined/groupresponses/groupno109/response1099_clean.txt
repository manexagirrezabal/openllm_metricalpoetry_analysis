The sun sets slow, the game's in full swing,
A battle of skill, a clash of kings.
The players give their all, they leave it on the field,
It's baseball, a game of heroes, a sport to yield.

The crack of bat, the ball takes flight,
A home run, oh what a sight.
The fans jump up, they cheer and clap,
It's baseball, a sport to capture the map.
