Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, the world can shift its gears,
A new perspective, a different atmosphere.
What was once a challenge now turns ease,
A hurdle cleared, a new breeze.

An instance can be a time to grow,
A moment seized, a new way to know.
It's a chance to break the mold, to shatter fears,
To embrace the moment with open ears.

In an instant, we can find our strength,
A resilience that will forever length.
It's a time to rise above the pain,
To let go of doubt, to love again.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
A chance to bloom, a new destiny.
To embrace the moment with open heart,
To dance with life, a brand new start.
