Here's another poem about instances:

In an instant, the world can shift,
A new perspective, a different drift.
What was once certain now turns vague,
A haze of confusion, a cloudy stage.

An instance can be a chance to grow,
A time to learn, a new way to know.
It's an opportunity to break the mold,
To shatter expectations, to unfold.

In an instant, we can find our strength,
A resilience that will forever length.
It's a time to rise above the pain,
To let go of fear, to love again.

So let's not fear instances, but see,
A chance to bloom, a new destiny.
To embrace the moment with open heart,
To dance with life, a brand new start.
