Death, a passage to the unknown, a journey we must take,
A fate that befalls us all, a end we cannot escape.
The reaper's scythe, it cuts us down with ease,
A swift and silent end, a release from all disease.

Our bodies fade, our souls take flight,
To realms beyond this life, where all is made right.
In death, we find peace, a solace from the strife,
A place where pain and sorrow lose their sting and rife.

The grave, a home, where we'll rest until the end,
A sanctuary, where our spirits can descend.
Death, a mystery, a fate we all must face,
A journey to the unknown, a path we must embrace.

But fear not, for death is not the end,
For in its wake, a new beginning will transpire.
Our souls will rise, our spirits will soar,
To realms of light, where love will forever be.

A place of joy, where tears are no more,
Where laughter echoes, and love forever roars.
Death, a passage to the unknown,
A journey we must take, a fate we cannot own.

For in death, we'll find our true release,
A freedom from the chains that bind us tight.
Our souls will soar, our spirits will take flight,
In realms of light, where love will shine so bright.

And though our bodies may decay,
Our spirits will live on, in endless sway.
Death, a journey to the unknown,
A fate we all must face, a path we must be shown.
