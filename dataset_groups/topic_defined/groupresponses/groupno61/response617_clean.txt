Attention, oh attention, a treasure so fine
A gift to the mind, a treasured shrine
It focuses the thoughts, a beacon of light
In the darkness of distractions, a guiding sight

Amidst the noise, a voice doth stand out
A melody of reason, a gentle shout
The world may be loud, but attention prevails
A refuge from chaos, an oasis in the gales

Attention, oh attention, a fleeting thing
A moment's notice, then gone with the wind's wing
It roams the mind, a curious wanderer
Seeking to focus, to linger and ponder

Attention, oh attention, present in each moment
A gift beyond measure, a treasure to savor and enjoy
In the stillness, a voice doth whisper low
A reminder of beauty, in the silence that follows.

So let us cherish attention, this rare gift
And hold it close, like a treasured lift
For in its embrace, we find our true selves
And in its absence, we are lost in the wealth of delusions.

Attention, oh attention, a treasure so true
A gift to the heart, a love so pure and new
It shines a light, on the darkness within
And brings us closer, to the beauty that's been.

In the silence, a voice doth speak
A message of hope, a gentle seek
Attention, oh attention, a treasure so bright
A beacon of love, in the darkness of night.

Attention, oh attention, a treasure so dear
A gift to the soul, a love so clear and near
It shines a light, on the path ahead
And guides us home, to the love that's been said.

In the stillness, a voice doth whisper
A message of peace, a gentle surrender
Attention, oh attention, a treasure so pure
A gift to the heart, a love so sure and secure.
