Attention, oh attention, fleeting and brief
A moment's notice, then gone, like a thief
It roams the mind, a curious thing
Seeking to focus, to linger and cling

A flash of insight, a spark of thought
A glimmer of beauty, soon forgot
The world is loud, the mind is weak
Attention wanders, as thoughts do seek

In the noise, a voice doth cry
Amidst the chaos, a melody nigh
Amidst the distractions, a stillness abides
A refuge from the whirlwind's tides

Attention, oh attention, a gift so rare
Present in each moment, beyond compare
