In the dark of night, my phone lies still,
Its screen a blank, unyielding chill.
No notifications to stir its sleep,
My cell, a lifeless thing, does keep.

The minutes tick away, the hours pass,
My phone remains in endless grass.
No calls, no texts, no social media fray,
My cell, a silent, empty space, does stay.

But then, a sudden buzz, a light,
A message comes, my phone takes flight.
Its screen awakens, alive once more,
My cell, a tool, a friend, a score.

And with that, my phone springs to life,
A link to all the world's delight.
A connection to each far-off place,
My cell, a bridge to time and space.
