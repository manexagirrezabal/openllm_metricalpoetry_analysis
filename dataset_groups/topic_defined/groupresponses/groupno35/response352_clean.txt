Death, a silence that will speak
A stillness where our souls will seek
A peace that's found in endless rest
A place where pain and fear are blessed

The time will come, it's fate's decree
When our lives will cease to be
Our hearts will stop, our breath will still
And death's icy chill will fill

But fear not, for death is not the end
For in its wake, a new life will begin
A life of hope, of love, of light
Where shadows dance, and souls take flight

So let us embrace this final step
And find solace in eternal sleep
Where dreams will guide, and souls will soar
In the land where death is just a door.
