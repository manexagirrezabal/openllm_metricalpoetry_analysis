Death, a transition we all must face
A journey to a different place
Where our souls will find their grace

In the end, our time on earth will cease
Our bodies weak, our spirits release
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, we'll decrease

The final curtain call we'll take
Our memories live, our love will never break
A new chapter, our souls will undertake

Beyond the veil, a new life we'll know
A journey through the afterglow
In death, our spirits will forever grow.
