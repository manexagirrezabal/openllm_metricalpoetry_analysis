Death, a silence that descends
A farewell to all earthly friends
Eternal rest, a peaceful end

In the grave, we'll lay our heads
Our stories told, our lives are read
A final goodbye, our bodies bled

The grim reaper's icy touch
A passage to eternal such
Our souls will soar, our spirits clutch

Beyond the veil, we'll find our way
A journey through the afterglow
In death, a new life we'll begin, come what may.
