In the virtual world, they awake,
Instances, born for a specific sake.
Their purpose clear, their path defined,
A fleeting life, but oh so aligned.

With servers vast, they take their place,
A digital tide, an endless race.
Processing data, with each passing phase,
A never-ending quest, a digital haze.

Their lives are short, their fate is sealed,
But in their moment, they're revealing.
A glimpse of life, a flash of light,
A spark of purpose, in the digital night.

In silence, they work, without a sound,
A hidden world, beneath the ground.
Their legacy lives on, forever more,
A digital footprint, an endless score.
