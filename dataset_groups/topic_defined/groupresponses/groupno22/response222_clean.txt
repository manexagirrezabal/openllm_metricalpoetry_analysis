In the woods, the trees stand tall,
Their leaves rustle, a gentle call.
A brook babbles, a melody,
Nature's symphony, harmony.

The sun shines bright, the flowers bloom,
Colors dance, a room of perfume.
Birds sing sweet, their songs soar,
Nature's choir, an endless score.

The wind whispers, the trees sway,
A gentle lullaby, they play.
In nature's embrace, I find peace,
My heart, my soul, release.

And as I walk, the forest floor,
A carpet of leaves, a path to explore,
Nature's beauty, forever more,
A treasure trove, a gift to adore,
A source of wonder, awe and joy,
A reflection of life's simple employ.
