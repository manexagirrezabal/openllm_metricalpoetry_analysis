Here's another poem about baseball:

The sun shines bright, the grass so green,
A day at the ballpark, a scene so serene,
The players warm up, a ritual so keen,
The game begins, a story yet unseen.

The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
The ball flies high, a treat to meet,
The runners race, a thrill so neat,
A score, a cheer, the crowd can't beat.

The pitcher throws, a fire so bright,
The batter swings, a forceful might,
The infielders dive, a play so tight,
A double play, the game's delight.

The outfielders sprint, a race so true,
A fly ball caught, a play anew,
The crowd erupts, a cheer so strong,
The game of baseball, a tale so long.
