A year, a story, a tale to tell
Twelve months, each one a chapter to dwell
A chance to write, to create and to mend
To leave the past behind, and start anew again

The days go by, some fast, some slow
Each one a gift, a new chance to know
The sun rises high, the moon glows bright
A year of adventures, of dreams taking flight

The leaves fall off, the snow begins to fall
A season's rest, a time to hear the call
The world outside, a reflection of within
A year of growth, of love and forgiveness spin

So let us embrace this year with cheer
And make the most of every moment here
