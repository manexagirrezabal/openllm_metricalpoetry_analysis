The supermarket, a place of delight
Where food and drink, a wondrous sight
Canned and boxed, fresh and frozen too
A feast for the senses, as far as you do

The checkout lines, they slowly move
As you wait, your patience does prove
But when it's done, oh what a treat
Your groceries, homeward bound at your feet.
