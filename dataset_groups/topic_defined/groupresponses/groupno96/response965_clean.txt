In the supermarket, the aisles are long
A treasure trove, where shoppers belong
Fresh produce, meats, and bread galore
A feast for the senses, and more in store

The checkout lines, they slowly move
As you wait, your patience does prove
But when it's done, oh what a delight
Your groceries, homeward bound tonight.
