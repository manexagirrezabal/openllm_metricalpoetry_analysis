The supermarket, a bustling space
Where shoppers roam, in a frantic race
Carts filled high, with goods galore
A shopping spree, and then some more

The checkout lines, they slowly move
As you wait, your patience does prove
But when it's done, oh what a delight
Your groceries, homeward bound tonight.
