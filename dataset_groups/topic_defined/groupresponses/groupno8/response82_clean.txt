Love is a journey we embark,
A feeling that leaves its mark,
On my heart, your love does spark.

You are my sunshine in the rain,
My shelter from life's stormy pain,
With you, my love remains.

In your eyes, my heart finds peace,
A love so true, it never ceases,
With you, my soul releases.

Together we create a love so pure,
A bond that endures for sure,
Forever and always, our love endures.
