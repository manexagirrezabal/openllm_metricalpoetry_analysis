Love is a feeling so pure and true,
It fills my heart and soul anew,
With every beat, my love for you.

Your smile, your laugh, your eyes so bright,
Make my day shine with delight,
In your arms, I take flight.

You are my everything, my guiding star,
My forever love, my shining far,
In your love, I know who I are.

With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love so sweet,
Forever and always, our love to eat.
