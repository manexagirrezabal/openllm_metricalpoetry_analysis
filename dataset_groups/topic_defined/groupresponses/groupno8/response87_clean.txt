Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A feeling that takes flight,
In your eyes, my heart takes flight.

You are my forever, my always,
My love for you, it never falters,
In your arms, I find my home, where I belong.

With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love so sweet,
Forever and always, our love to eat.

Love is a journey we embark,
A feeling that leaves its mark,
On my heart, your love does spark, like a lark.
