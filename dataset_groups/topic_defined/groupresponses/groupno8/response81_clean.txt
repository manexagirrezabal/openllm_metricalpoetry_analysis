Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A feeling that takes flight,
In your eyes, my heart takes flight.

Your touch ignites a fire so true,
A passion that's pure and new,
With you, my love shines through.

You are my forever, my always,
My love for you, it never falters,
In your arms, I find my home.

Together we create a love so strong,
A bond that lasts all lifelong,
Forever and always, our love song.
