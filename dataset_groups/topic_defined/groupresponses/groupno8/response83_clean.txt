Love is a gift we give and receive,
A feeling that we can't conceive,
It's the beat of our hearts, it's what we believe.

You are my forever, my always,
My love for you, it never falters,
In your arms, I find my home, where I belong.

With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love so sweet,
Forever and always, our love to eat.

Love is a journey we embark,
A feeling that leaves its mark,
On my heart, your love does spark, like a lark.
