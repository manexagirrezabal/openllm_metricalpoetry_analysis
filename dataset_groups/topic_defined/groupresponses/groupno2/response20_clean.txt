My love, you are the sunshine in my day,
Warming my heart and brightening my way.
You are the star that guides me through the night,
A beacon of hope and a source of delight.

Your touch ignites a fire within my soul,
Melting my fears and making me whole.
With you by my side, I feel complete,
Together we create a love that's sweet.
