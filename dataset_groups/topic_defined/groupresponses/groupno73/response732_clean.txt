A year, a chapter, a story to tell
A cycle of seasons, a life to live
A chance to grow, a chance to excel

The days go by, the weeks pass too fast
A year of adventure, a year that will last
A year of learning, a year that will pass

The sun rises high, the moon glows bright
A year of hope, a year that takes flight
A year of dreams, a year that ignites

The clock ticks away, the calendar turns
A year of memories, a year that burns
A year of love, a year that endures
