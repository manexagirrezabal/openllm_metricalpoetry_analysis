A year, a cycle, a season to share
A chance to grow, a chance to prepare
A year of hope, a year that's fair

The days go by, the weeks pass too fast
A year of adventure, a year that will last
A year of learning, a year that will pass

The sun rises high, the moon glows bright
A year of dreams, a year that takes flight
A year of love, a year that's tight

The clock ticks away, the calendar turns
A year of memories, a year that burns
A year of joy, a year that endures
