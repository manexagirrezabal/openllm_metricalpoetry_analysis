My pleasure, here is a poem with 2 stanzas about love:

Love is a river that flows so deep
A feeling that we can't help but keep
It's the smile on our face when we're with that special one
The joy in our heart that has just begun

Love is a gift that we give and receive
A treasure that we can't conceive
It's the laughter and tears that we share and believe
The happiness that love brings, it's a treasure to achieve
