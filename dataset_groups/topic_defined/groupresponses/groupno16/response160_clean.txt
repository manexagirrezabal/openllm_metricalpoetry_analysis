In the forest, the trees stand tall
Their leaves rustle, a gentle call
A brook babbles, a melody small
The earthy scent, a sweet perfume to all

The sky above, a brilliant blue
Birds chirp and sing, a symphony anew
The sun shines bright, its warmth so true
Bringing life to all, as it shines anew

In nature's embrace, I find my peace
A sense of calm, a world to cease
From the strife and noise of city's release
I find solace, in nature's gentle ease.
