Here's another short poem about an instance:

In the vast expanse of time, I am but a moment,
A singular instance, a flash of light in the tumult.
I exist for a brief instant, then fade away,
A snowflake falling, a fleeting sight.
But in this moment, I am alive,
A spark of life, a flash of drive.
I am a single instance, unique and rare,
A moment in time, beyond compare.
