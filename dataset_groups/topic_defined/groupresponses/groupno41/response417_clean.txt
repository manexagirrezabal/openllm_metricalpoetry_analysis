Here's another short poem about an instance:

I am a moment in time, a singular instance,
A flash of life, a burst of existence.
I exist for a brief second, then gone,
A snowflake falling, a fleeting dawn.
But in this instant, I am free,
A spark of joy, a wild, carefree.
I am a single instance, pure and true,
A moment in time, anew.
