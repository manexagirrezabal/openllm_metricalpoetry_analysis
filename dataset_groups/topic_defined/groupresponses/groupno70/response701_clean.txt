A year, a orbit of time so grand,
A cycle of seasons, a chance to expand.
From budding hopes to harvest cheer,
It's a journey that brings us near.

The months go by, each one a breeze,
A story of growth, a tale to seize.
From frosty winter to summer's warm embrace,
It's a year of change, a chance to find our place.
