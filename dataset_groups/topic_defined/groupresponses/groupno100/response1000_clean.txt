Aisles of wonder, rows of delight
Fresh produce beckons, morning light
Bread and pasta, a culinary dream
Satisfying snacks, a symphony to gleam

Shelves of treasure, a cornucopia to explore
Canned and boxed, a feast for four
Drinks and sweets, a taste sensation
A supermarket experience, pure elation

Fragrant flowers, colorful display
Meats and seafood, a savory way
Specialty cheeses, a gourmet's delight
Satisfying shopping, day or night

A supermarket so vast and grand
Where culinary dreams take flight.
