Love is a feeling that's hard to define,
It's a force that's always on my mind.
With you, my heart beats faster,
My love for you will never be disaster.

Your eyes are the windows to my soul,
They show me the beauty that I know.
In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
My love for you will forever embrace.

You are the melody that fills my heart,
The one that makes my love from the start.
With every kiss and touch, my love for you grows,
Together, our love will forever glows.

Love is a journey we'll take with faith,
Hand in hand, we'll face life's ups and downs with grace.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
My love for you will forever be won.
