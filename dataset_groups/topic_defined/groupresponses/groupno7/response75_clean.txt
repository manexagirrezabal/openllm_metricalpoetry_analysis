Love is a flame that burns so bright,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
In your eyes, my heart finds a home,
With you, my love will forever roam.

Your touch ignites a fire within,
Melting my fears and soothing my skin.
With every kiss, my love for you grows,
Together, our love will forever glow.

You are the sunshine in my day,
Bringing light and joy in every way.
In your arms, I find my peaceful place,
My love for you will forever embrace.

Love is a journey we'll take with grace,
Hand in hand, we'll face life's ups and downs with pace.
Through laughter and tears, we'll stand as one,
My love for you will forever be won.
