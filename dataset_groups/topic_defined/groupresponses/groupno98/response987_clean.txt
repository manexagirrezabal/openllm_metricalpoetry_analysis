A supermarket of wonders, a feast for the eyes
Fresh produce in abundance, the colors arise
A symphony of flavors, a culinary delight
The supermarket's treasures, a true sensory sight

The aisles of plenty, a shopper's paradise
Canned and packaged, a convenience surprise
Snacks and sweets, a tasty treat in store
The supermarket's bounty, for all to explore

The checkout lines, a waiting game with grace
Shoppers eager, their prizes to embrace
The supermarket's treasures, now in hand with glee
A satisfied crowd, a happy family

The supermarket's magic, a place of delight
A world of wonder, a shopper's delight
Where hunger meets satisfaction, a true delight
The supermarket's treasures, a beacon of light.
