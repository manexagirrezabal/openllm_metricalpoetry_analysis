Aisles of wonder, rows of delight
Fresh produce beckons, shoppers take flight
Carts filled with goodies, baskets overflow
The supermarket's treasures, for all to know

Fruits and veggies, a colorful sight
Bread and bakery, a tempting plight
Meats and cheeses, a savory delight
The supermarket's feast, a true delight

Canned and packaged, aisles of ease
Snacks and sweets, a tasty tease
Drinks and juices, a refreshing find
The supermarket's bounty, for all to mind

Checkout lines, a waiting game
Shoppers eager, their prizes to claim
The supermarket's treasures, now in hand
A satisfied crowd, a happy band.
