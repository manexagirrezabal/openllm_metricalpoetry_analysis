The sun sets slow, the game's in full swing
A pitch, a hit, the crowd starts to sing
The players give their all, their hearts on fire
The game is life, their passion's desire

The infield's hot, the outfield's wide
A play's made, the crowd's inside
The umpire calls the strikes, the catcher throws
The bases are loaded, the game is in tow

A steal, a slide, a cloud of dust
A run scores, the game is a must
The players high-five, their spirits alive
The game's a joy, their hearts are thriving

In the bleachers, fans cheer and shout
Their team's ahead, they're on a rollout
Hot dogs and popcorn, peanuts too
The snacks are abundant, the game's anew
