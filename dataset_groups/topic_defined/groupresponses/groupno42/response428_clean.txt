An instance, oh so brief,
A snapshot in time, a glimpse of belief.
A fleeting thought, a flash of insight,
A glimmer of hope, a spark of light.
The instance passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that instance, we felt alive,
A chance to stand, a moment to shine.
So let us cherish these instances dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.

I hope this poem captures the essence of an instance and its fleeting nature. The poem highlights how instances can bring a spark of hope and a glimmer of light, making them grand and special. It also emphasizes the importance of cherishing these moments and holding them close, despite their brevity.

Here's a revised version of the poem with 14 lines, using the word "moment" instead of "instance":

A moment, oh so brief,
A snapshot in time, a glimpse of belief.
A fleeting thought, a flash of insight,
A glimmer of hope, a spark of light.
The moment passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A chance to stand, a moment to shine.
So let us cherish these moments dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.

I hope this revised version captures the essence of a moment and its fleeting nature even better. The poem emphasizes the importance of cherishing these moments and holding them close, despite their brevity. It also highlights how moments can bring a spark of hope and a glimmer of light, making them grand and special.
