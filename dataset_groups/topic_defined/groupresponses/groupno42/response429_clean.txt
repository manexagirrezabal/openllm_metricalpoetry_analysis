A moment, oh so brief,
A snapshot in time, a glimpse of belief.
A fleeting thought, a flash of insight,
A glimmer of hope, a spark of light.
The moment passes, lost in the fray,
Leaving only memories to stay.
Yet still we cling to what has been,
A lingering shadow of what's within.
For in that moment, we felt alive,
A chance to stand, a moment to shine.
So let us cherish these moments dear,
And hold them close, without fear.
They may be small, but they're so grand,
A moment of joy, a chance to stand.
