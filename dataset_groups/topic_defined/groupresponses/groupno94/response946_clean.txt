The supermarket, a place of joy,
Where shopping lists and dreams employ.
Fresh produce, a colorful display,
Bread and pastries, a delicious way.

Meats and cheeses, a savory delight,
Canned goods and snacks, a satisfying bite.
Drinks and juices, a refreshing treat,
A world of flavors, at your feet.

The aisles stretch out, a maze to navigate,
Shelves stacked high, a treasure to cultivate.
Shopping carts and baskets, at the ready,
A place where needs and wants are met with glee.

The supermarket, a place of wonder,
A haven of goods, a shopper's thunder
