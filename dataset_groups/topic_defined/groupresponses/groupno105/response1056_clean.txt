The sun shines bright, the grass is green,
A battle of skills, a game of dreams.
The pitcher winds up, the batter swings,
A hit, a run, the crowd sings.
The shortstop makes a play, the outfielders too,
A double play, the game is new.
The final out, the game is won,
The players celebrate, the crowd is gone.
