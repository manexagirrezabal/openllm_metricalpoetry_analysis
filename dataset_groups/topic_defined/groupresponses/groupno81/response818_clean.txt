A cell, a tiny unit of life
The foundation of all living strife
It grows, it divides, it thrives and dies
In endless cycles, with no surprise

Its walls, a membrane thin and strong
Keep contents inside, where they belong
The cytoplasm, a fluid alive
Where chemical reactions take their drive

The nucleus, a kernel of command
Holds genes, the blueprints of the land
It guides the cell, on its path to growth
Through mitosis, it never loses its oath
