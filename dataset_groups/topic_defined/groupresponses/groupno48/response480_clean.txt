In the stillness of the night,
The stars shone with all their might.
Their twinkle reached far and wide,
And lit up the world with delight.

In the morning's golden glow,
The sun rose high in the sky,
Bringing warmth and light to all,
As it banished the night's shy.

In the midst of the day's busy throng,
The world spun round with joy and song,
A kaleidoscope of sound and sight,
A symphony of color and light.

And in the instant's grace,
The universe revealed its face,
A moment of pure, unadulterated bliss,
A flash of insight, a glimpse of the divine.
