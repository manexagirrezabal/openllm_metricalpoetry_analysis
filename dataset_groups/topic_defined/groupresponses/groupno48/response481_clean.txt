In the ticking of the clock,
Time passed by with steady rock,
The moments blended, one by one,
As the hours slowly had their fun.

In the rush of life's pursuit,
The days went by in a whirlpool suit,
The world outside was loud and bright,
A never-ending race, a constant fight.

But in the instance's embrace,
I found a peaceful, quiet space,
A moment of clarity, free from time,
A chance to be still, to align.

And in that instant's heart,
I discovered a brand new start,
A fresh beginning, a clean slate,
A chance to create my own fate.
