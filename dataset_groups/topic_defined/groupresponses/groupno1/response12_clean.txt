My love, you are the waves that gently roll,
Soothing my soul, and making my heart whole.
You are the sand that holds my hand,
A steady foundation, a love so grand.
In your eyes, I see a love so pure,
A love that's unbreakable, forever secure.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will last all lifelong.
