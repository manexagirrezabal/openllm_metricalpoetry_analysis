My love, you are the mountain peak,
A height of love that I can't even seek.
You are the valley below,
A love that's unbreakable, forever to know.
In your eyes, I see a love so pure,
A reflection of the love that's in my heart for sure.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
