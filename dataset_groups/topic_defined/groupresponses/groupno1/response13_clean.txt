My love, you are the light that shines so bright,
Guiding me through the darkest night.
You are the hope that gives me strength,
A beacon of love that never fades or length.
In your eyes, I see a love so true,
A love that's unbreakable, forever new.
Together, we create a love so strong,
Forever and always, our love will never be wrong.
