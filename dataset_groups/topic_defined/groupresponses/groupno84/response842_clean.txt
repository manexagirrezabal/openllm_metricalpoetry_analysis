A cell, a tiny room,
A place where life is walled in.
A space that's bare, a soul that's trapped,
A world that's limited, a future that's mapped.

The walls that confine, so strong and thick,
A cage that holds a heart, a spirit that's quick.
The floor that's hard, the ceiling low,
A space that's meant to keep the body slow.

But in this cell, there's hope that remains,
A spark that burns, a fire that sustains.
The days that pass, the nights that fall,
A life that's stuck, but not defeated at all.

For in this cell, there's time to think,
A mind that wanders, a heart that links.
To memories of past, to dreams of future,
A soul that's strong, a will that's tenacious and sure.
