A tiny space, a world apart,
A cell that holds a heart.
A place where thoughts are made to roam,
Where freedom's just a distant home.

The walls that confine, so strong and thick,
A cage that holds a soul, so sick.
The floor that's hard, the ceiling low,
A space that's bare, with nothing to show.

The door that locks, the key that turns,
A passage to a world that yearns.
A world outside, so bright and free,
A place where hope and joy can be.

But in this cell, all hope seems lost,
A soul that's trapped, with no way to boast.
The days that pass, the nights that fall,
A life that's stuck, with no escape at all.
