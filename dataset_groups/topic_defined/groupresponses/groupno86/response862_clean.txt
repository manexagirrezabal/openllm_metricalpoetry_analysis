A cell, a tiny universe,
A world of wonder, infinite and diverse.
Its walls, a membrane, thin and curved.

The nucleus, a central sun,
A source of light, life's beginnings have begun.
The DNA, a code, forever spun.

Mitochondria, like stars, they shine,
Energy they produce, in abundance and divine.
Fueling life, their work is sublime.

Ribosomes, the protein makers,
Building blocks of life, no fakes or flakes.
Their work, a never-ending rhyme.
