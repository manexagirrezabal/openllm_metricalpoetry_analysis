Attention, oh attention, a treasure so rare
A gift we crave, a treasure beyond compare
In a world full of noise, it's a precious find
A moment's peace, a gentle breeze that aligns

We search for it, we seek and we yearn
A connection, a bond, a gentle concern
In the chaos, we crave its embrace
A moment's notice, a smile on our face

But attention's a thief, it slips away
Leaving us grasping, begging to stay
It dances and teases, it plays and flirts
Leaving us wanting, in endless pursuit

So we cry out, we plead and we pray
For just a moment, a glimmer of ray
Of attention's light, of its shining grace
To feel seen, heard, to find our place.

And when we finally grasp it, oh how sweet
The feeling of being seen, being complete
The world fades away, and it's just us and the moment
In a embrace that's warm, and comforting, and potent.

Attention's touch ignites a fire within
A flame that burns bright, and never dims
It's a feeling that's hard to describe
But it's one of the most beautiful things we can experience.

So let's cherish attention, let's hold it tight
Let's give it the value, the worth it deserves
For in a world full of noise and distractions
Attention is a treasure that shines like a star.

Let's not take it for granted, let's not forget
The power of attention, the love it can get
It's a gift that's priceless, a treasure so rare
A moment of connection, a bond that's beyond compare.
