Attention, oh attention, a treasure so fine
A gift we crave, a treasure divine
In a world full of noise, it's a rare find
A moment's peace, a gentle wind that aligns

We search for it, we seek and we yearn
A connection, a bond, a gentle concern
In the chaos, we crave its embrace
A moment's notice, a smile on our face

But attention's a thief, it slips away
Leaving us grasping, begging to stay
It dances and teases, it plays and flirts
Leaving us wanting, in endless pursuit

So we cry out, we plead and we pray
For just a moment, a glimmer of ray
Of attention's light, of its shining grace
To feel seen, heard, to find our place.

And when we finally grasp it, oh how sweet
The feeling of being seen, being complete
The world fades away, and it's just us and the moment
In a embrace that's warm, and comforting, and potent.
