The crack of the bat, a sound so sweet,
A home run hit, the crowd can't be beat.
The grass is green, the sun shines bright,
A day at the ballpark, pure delight.
Players hustle, giving their all,
Fans cheer, standing tall.
The game of baseball, a true delight,
A national pastime, a pure joy to behold in sight.
