The pitcher winds up, the ball takes flight,
A fastball, curveball, or slice of light.
The batter swings, a hit or miss,
The outcome uncertain, the crowd's thrill.
The infielders dive, the outfielders race,
A double play, a triple ace.
The game of baseball, a strategic dance,
A symphony of skills, a test of chance.
