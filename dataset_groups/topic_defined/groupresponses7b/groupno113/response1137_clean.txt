On the field of dreams they play,
Their hearts and souls in every way,
With passion burning bright and true,
And every game a victory anew.

In the outfield, they chase and run,
Their speed and agility won,
With gloves that snag and throw so true,
And every catch a victory anew.

With every play a story to be told,
And every season a tale of gold,
Baseball's magic lives on so bold,
And in our hearts forever to hold.
