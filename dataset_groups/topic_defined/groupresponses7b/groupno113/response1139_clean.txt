On the field of dreams they play,
Their hearts and souls in every way,
With passion burning bright and true,
And every game a victory anew.

In the outfield, they chase and run,
Their speed and agility won,
With gloves that snag and throw so true,
And every catch a victory anew.

Baseball's magic lives on so bold,
And in our hearts forever to hold,
A game of skill, a game of heart,
A sport that brings us joy from the start
