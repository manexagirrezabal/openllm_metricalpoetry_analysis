On the diamond, heroes rise,
Their skills and strength in the skies,
With every swing of the bat so sweet,
And every pitch a treat to greet.

In the outfield, they chase and run,
Their speed and agility won,
With gloves that snag and throw so true,
And every catch a victory anew.

The crowd cheers on with joyful sound,
As players give their all around,
With passion burning in each soul so bright,
And every game a delightful sight.
