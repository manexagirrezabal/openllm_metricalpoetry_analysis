The sun shines bright on the lush green field,
A place where heroes are born and deals are sealed.
The crack of the bat echoes through the air,
As players give their all, beyond compare.

From the opening pitch to the final out,
Baseball is a game that's truly devout.
It's more than just a sport, it's a way of life,
A source of joy and excitement, strife and spouse.

So let us cheer for our favorite team,
And enjoy the thrill of this classic dream.
For baseball is a game that will always stand,
A symbol of America, strong and grand.
