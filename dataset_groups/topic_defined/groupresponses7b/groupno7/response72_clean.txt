Love is a garden of delight,
A beauty that takes flight.
It's a feeling that shines so bright,
A treasure that's always in sight.

Love is a soft and gentle breeze,
That brings us joy and ease.
It's a bond that forever grows,
A treasure that we hold with glows.

Love is a flame that burns so true,
A feeling that's always new.
It's a gift that brings us joy anew,
A treasure that we hold in view.

Love is a heart that beats with grace,
A feeling that fills the space.
It's a bond that forever embraces,
A treasure that we hold in trust and pace
