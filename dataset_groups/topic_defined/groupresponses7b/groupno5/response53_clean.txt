Love is a journey we embark upon,
A path that winds and twists, but leads us to your heart.
It's the look in your eyes, the touch of your hand,
The whispered words that make my soul stand.

In your arms, I find my haven and peace,
A place where I can rest, release, and cease.
Love is a gift that fills my life with light,
A treasure that makes every moment feel just right.
