Love is a fire that burns deep within,
A flame that flickers with every kiss and grin.
It's the laughter we share, the memories we make,
The comfort of knowing our love will never fade.

With you by my side, I feel so complete,
Together we create a love that can't be beat.
Our hearts beat as one, our love will forever grow,
In your arms is where I belong, and I know
