Love is a garden that blooms in spring,
A beauty that makes our hearts sing.
It's the smile of a newborn baby's face,
The warm embrace that fills the space.

In your eyes, my love, I see a light,
A shining star that guides me through the night.
With you by my side, I know we'll be alright,
Together our love will forever take flight
