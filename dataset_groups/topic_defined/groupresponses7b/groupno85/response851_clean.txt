Inside my body, tiny worlds exist,
Cells divide and grow, a never-ending quest.
Within these walls, life's mysteries unfold,
A microscopic realm where secrets are told.

The cell membrane, thin and strong,
Protects the inner workings, where magic's sung.
Enzymes and hormones, they dance and play,
Chemical reactions, life's symphony in gray.

DNA, the blueprint, a code so grand,
Instructions for growth, a plan so land.
Ribosomes, the builders, work with care,
Translating genes, with precision fair and square.

Inside each cell, a world of its own,
A universe of wonder, where life is known.
So let us marvel at these tiny things,
For inside each cell, a miracle brings.
