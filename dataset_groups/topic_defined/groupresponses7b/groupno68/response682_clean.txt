The year unwinds, a tale of time,
With memories made and lessons in rhyme.
From birth to death, it's a journey we take,
A cycle of life, a story to make.

With every passing day, new adventures come,
And with each moment, our hearts are won.
The year unfolds, a story so bright,
A chapter in the book of life that's tight
