The year unfolds, a story long,
A chapter in the book of life that's strong.
With every passing day, new memories made,
And lessons learned, for life to be played.

From dawn till dusk, the year goes by,
A journey of growth, with laughter and sighs.
With every step, a new path we find,
And with each moment, our hearts entwined.
