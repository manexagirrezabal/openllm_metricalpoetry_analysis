Death, the great divider,
A fate we all must face, and pay the price,
Leaving behind our mortal coil,
To find peace in the afterlife's soil.

In the end, it's not what we own,
Or who we know or love alone,
But how we lived and loved,
That will be remembered when we're gone.

The grave may keep its secret,
But our memories will never depart,
For though our bodies fade away,
Our souls shine on, forever intertwined in the heart.

Death may be the end of life,
But it's not the end of love and light,
For though we leave this world behind,
Our spirits live on, forever entwined
