Inside my body, a tiny world
A microcosm of life and its unfurl
Cells divide and grow, a never-ending dance
A marvel of nature, a wondrous trance

They multiply, they adapt, they change
Evolving new forms, rearranging
Their structures, their functions, their fate
A constant process, a never-ending debate

From the simplest to the most complex
Each cell a universe, a world of progress
A kaleidoscope of life and its might
A poem for each cell, a wondrous sight.
