In an instant, the world can change
From bright to dark, from light to strange
A moment's notice, a single flash
And everything we knew was gone in a rush

Like a photograph, frozen in time
An instance captured, forever defined
A glimpse of beauty, a fleeting sight
That vanishes without a fight

In an instant, our lives can twist
From joy to sorrow, from hope to distress
A split-second decision, a single breath
And everything we knew was wrenched from death

Like a dream that fades with dawn's light
An instance lost, in the morning's sight
A moment's grace, a flash of insight
That vanishes like mist at first light.
