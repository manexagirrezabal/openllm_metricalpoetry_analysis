Death approaches, slow and near,
A silent guest, a final fear.
But let us not be afraid, my dear,
For in its embrace, we'll find peaceful cheer.

In death's arms, we find release,
From the pains and sufferings we've seen.
Our souls will soar, free and light,
In the beauty of eternal night.

So let us not resist, but surrender,
To death's gentle touch, a love letter.
For in its embrace, we'll find our peace,
And our journey to the next cease.[/INST: << /sys/inst>>]
