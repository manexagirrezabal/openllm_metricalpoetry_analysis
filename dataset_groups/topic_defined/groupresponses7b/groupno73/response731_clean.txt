Years go by like a flowing stream,
Time's swift passage, a dream.
Memories made, moments shared, and lives lived,
But still, the clock ticks on, and we're given.

Summer sunshine bright, winter's chill embrace,
Seasons come and go, a constant pace.
Birthdays mark our journey, growth in every stage,
A lifetime of experiences, a tale to be told with pride.

Springtime blooms with hope, summer's heat,
Autumn's hues, a season to retreat.
Winter's snow and ice, a time for rest,
Nature's rhythm, ever-changing guest.

Summer days are long, winter nights are short,
A cycle of life, forever to be sought.
Years go by like minutes, moments slipped away,
Time's mysterious ways, we can never stay.
