Stanza 1:
In the aisles of gold and green,
Where food and drinks are always seen,
The supermarket's bustling hive,
A place where shoppers come to thrive.

Stanza 2:
From canned goods to fresh produce,
The shelves are stocked with endless choose,
Fruits and vegetables of every kind,
A feast for eyes and taste alike to find.

Stanza 3:
The cashiers ring up purchases fast,
As shoppers wait in line at last,
Their baskets filled with treats so fine,
A shopping trip that's truly divine.

Stanza 4:
As shoppers leave the store so bright,
They feel their bellies full of delight,
The supermarket's magic spell,
A place where dreams are sold so well.
