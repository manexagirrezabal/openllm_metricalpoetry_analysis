Stanza 1:
In the cool, well-lit space,
Fresh produce and goods abound,
From fruits and veggies to grace,
To canned goods that last all round.

Stanza 2:
The shelves are stocked high and wide,
With foods from far and near inside,
Shoppers search for treats with glee,
As they fill their baskets with delight.

Stanza 3:
Carts loaded with goods so fine,
Shoppers navigate the crowded line,
The cashiers ring up the bill with care,
As shoppers make their final fare.

Stanza 4:
As shoppers leave the store so bright,
They feel their bellies full of delight,
The supermarket's magic spell,
A place where dreams are sold so well.
