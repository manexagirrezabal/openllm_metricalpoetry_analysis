Stanza 1:
In the sterile lights of the store,
A world of food and more,
From cans to fresh produce galore,
A feast for all, forevermore.

Stanza 2:
The shelves so high, the aisles so wide,
Shoppers roam with purpose inside,
From bread to milk, from eggs to rice,
A cornucopia of endless surprise.

Stanza 3:
Carts filled with treats and more,
Shoppers check their lists once more,
The cashiers ring up the bill,
As shoppers make their final thrill.

Stanza 4:
As shoppers leave the store so bright,
They feel their bellies full of delight,
The supermarket's magic spell,
A place where dreams are sold so well.
