Inside the body's tiniest space,
Cells divide with grace,
A tiny world of wonder race.

Their walls are strong and thick,
Protecting life inside,
A secret world we can't quick.

With DNA that's neat and tidy,
Cells work in perfect time,
A dance of life and death, you see.

In every part of our body,
Cells are hard at work,
Keeping us alive and free
