The crack of the bat, the ball soars high
Fans on their feet, they can't deny
The excitement on the field, it's plain to see

The pitcher winds up, the crowd holds its breath
A swing and a miss, the batter's release
The game is heating up, the tension high

Home run! The ball soars through the night
Fans erupt in cheers, a joyful sight
The crowd goes wild, a magical flight

Stolen base! The runner takes off with ease
A quick slide into second, a successful breeze
The team works together, a well-rehearsed play
