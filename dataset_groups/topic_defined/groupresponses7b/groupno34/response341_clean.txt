Death's dark veil doth lift from sight,
Revealing all the wonders of the night.
In death's embrace I find my peace at last,
And leave behind this world of toil and haste.

The cold earth welcomes me with open arms,
Where all my worries and my fears are charmed.
No more will pain or sorrow seize the day,
But in eternal rest I shall find my way.

Death's icy touch it doth release at last,
As life's sweet memories fade away at last.
The weight of years it starts to let go,
And in the grave I shall be free at last to know.

In death's cold arms I find my final rest,
Where all my worries and my cares are blessed.
No more will fear or sorrow plague my mind,
But in the silence I shall find my final find.
