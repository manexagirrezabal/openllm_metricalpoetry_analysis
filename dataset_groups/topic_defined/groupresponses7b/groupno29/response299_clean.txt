Death, the great unknown,
A fate we all must face alone.
It comes for us unawares,
And takes us to the other shore.

In life, we search for fame,
But in death, our names are forgot.
The world keeps turning still,
While we lie silently in the dust.

The memories we leave behind,
Are all that's left of us to find.
And though we may be gone,
Our legacy lives on and on.

But even in death, we're free,
From the chains that bound us here below.
We soar on wings of light and grace,
To a place where love and joy embrace.

The end of life is just a new beginning,
A chance to dance with the angels spinning.
In death, we find our true selves,
And join the ranks of those who dwell in heaven's wealth.

And though we may be gone,
Our love will live on and on.
For in death, we're not alone,
We're carried by the hearts that hold us dear, to a place where we'll forever shine.

In death, we find our true home,
Where love and joy are forever known.
And though we may be gone,
Our spirit lives on and on.
For in death, we're not forgotten,
We're remembered and loved, and our legacy is forever unbroken
