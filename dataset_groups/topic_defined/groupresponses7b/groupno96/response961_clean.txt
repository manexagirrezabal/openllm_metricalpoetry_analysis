In the supermarket, rows of shelves are high
Packed with food and drinks, to make your heart fly
From fresh produce to canned goods on the go
A world of flavors, for you to know

The cashier rings up your items with a smile
As you bag them up, your groceries pile
You leave the store, feeling satisfied and light
With your treasures in hand, for a tasty night
