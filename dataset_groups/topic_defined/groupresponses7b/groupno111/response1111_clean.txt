The crack of the bat, a sweet sound
As the ball flies through the air
A home run, a base hit found
In this game of skill beyond compare

The pitcher's spin, a wicked art
As he throws with all his might
The catcher's glove, a barrier to part
And the runner's feet, they take flight

The infield's dusty ground
Where plays are made and lost
The outfield's green expanse
Where heroes are crowned and boos are raised

The crowd's roar, a deafening sound
As fans cheer on their team with glee
Baseball's magic, a joy to be found
In this game of skill and strategy
