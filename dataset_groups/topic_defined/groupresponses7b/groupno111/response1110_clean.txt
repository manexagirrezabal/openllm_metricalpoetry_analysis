Strike one, the ball sails by
As the crowd gasps in dismay
The pitcher's got a wicked eye
And the hitter's in disarray

Strike two, the ball hits the ground
As the runner races around
The outfield's vast and wide
And the batter can't hide

Home run! The crowd goes wild
As the ball soars through the sky
A home run is worth its weight in gold
And the player's on top of the world

Stolen base! The runner's fast
And beats the throw with ease
Speed and agility, a joy to watch
In this game of skill and finesse
