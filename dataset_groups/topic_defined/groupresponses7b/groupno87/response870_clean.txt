In the depths of cells, a world unfolds
Where life's building blocks are stored and told
From DNA to proteins, they play their part
In keeping the body's functions in the heart

In each cell, a tiny universe resides
With molecules that dance and collide
A complex system, where order reigns
And life's processes are sustained by gained

As cells divide and multiply with grace
The body's needs are met with haste
A marvel of nature, pure and true
A cell is the foundation, anew.
