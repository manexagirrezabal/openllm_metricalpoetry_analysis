Death, the great divide, so vast and wide,
A journey we'll take, when our time has come to reside.
It brings an end to life's short span,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been, if only we had a plan.

In death, we find release from pain,
A final rest after life's vain strain.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and peace remain
