Death, the great equalizer of all,
A fate we'll face, whatever our fall.
It brings an end to life's short span,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been.

In death, we find release from pain,
A final rest after life's vain strain.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and peace remain.
