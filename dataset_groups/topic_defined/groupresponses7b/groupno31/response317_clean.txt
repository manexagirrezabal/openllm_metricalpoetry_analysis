Death, the end of life's brief race,
A moment's pause before eternity's embrace.
It brings an end to all our dreams and schemes,
Leaving us with memories of what could have been, if only we had a theme.

In death, we find peace from life's strife,
A quiet rest after a world full of strive.
The soul is free from earthly chains,
Gone to a place where love and joy remain
