The sun sets slow and paints the sky,
A fiery hue that makes me sigh.
The stars come out, one by one,
And night's sweet silence has begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful tune,
As autumn leaves their branches moan.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

The year draws to a close, so bright,
With memories both dark and light.
The lessons learned, the tears and strife,
As we bid farewell to life.
