The sun sets slow, a fiery hue,
As day gives way to night's sweet brew.
The stars appear, one by one,
And night's silence has just begun.

The wind it howls, a mournful tune,
As autumn leaves their branches moan.
The trees stand tall, though battered and worn,
Their beauty still, despite the storm.

Year comes to an end, so bright,
With memories both dark and light.
The lessons learned, the tears and strife,
As we bid farewell to life.
