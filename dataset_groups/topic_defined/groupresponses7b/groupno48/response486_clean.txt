In the flicker of a thought, we find our voice
A moment's inspiration, a choice to make a choice
But in the instance, we must be bold
And trust that change will lead us to a brighter hold.

With every breath, a dream unfolds
Of moments lived, of memories told
In instances of love, we find our grace
And learn to embrace the present place.

In the flash of insight, a truth is found
A moment's realization, a life resound
But in each instance, we find our strength
And learn to face the future with length.
