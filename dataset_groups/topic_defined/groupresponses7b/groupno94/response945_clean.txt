The supermarket's bustling noise,
A place where I find what I choose.
From snacks to treats, and drinks too,
In this supermarket, my shopping mood will do.

The cashiers ring up my purchase with ease,
My cart full of goods, my shopping spree will please.
I leave the store, feeling satisfied and light,
In this supermarket, everything's just right
