The supermarket's shelves are so high,
A place where I find what I try.
From snacks to drinks, and fresh produce too,
In this supermarket, my shopping spree will do.

The cashiers ring up my purchase with ease,
My cart full of goods, my shopping spree will please.
I leave the store, feeling satisfied and light,
In this supermarket, everything's just right.
