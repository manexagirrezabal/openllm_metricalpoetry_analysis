In the supermarket, shelves so high,
Products galore for me to buy.
Fresh produce, canned goods too,
Everything I need, they have in store for me and you.

The cashiers smile as I pay,
My cart full of treats for the day.
I leave with satisfaction, feeling content,
In this supermarket, my shopping trip is bent.
