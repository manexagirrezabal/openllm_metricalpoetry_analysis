In the supermarket, I find my escape,
A place where I can leave my worries in the shape.
From fresh produce to canned delight,
I fill my cart with treats that bring me light.

The colors and lights of the store entice,
Sweet treats and savory fare, my heart's excise.
With each item I place in my cart with care,
I know I'll find peace beyond compare.

In this bustling space I find my calm,
A refuge from the world's ceaseless storm.
Wherever life may take me far or near,
The supermarket will always be dear.
