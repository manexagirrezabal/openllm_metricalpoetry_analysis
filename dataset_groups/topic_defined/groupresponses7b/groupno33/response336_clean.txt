Death's dark shadow looms,
A grim reminder of our fate.
The end of life's sweet song,
A time for us to be gone.

In the land of eternal rest,
We'll find our final home.
Where dreams of life are sealed,
And all our cares are undone.

Death's gentle touch doth claim,
The lives that earth does hold.
But in death's peaceful frame,
We'll find a soul to unfold.

In death's embrace we'll find,
A love that knows no end.
For though it takes us home,
Our spirits will transcend
