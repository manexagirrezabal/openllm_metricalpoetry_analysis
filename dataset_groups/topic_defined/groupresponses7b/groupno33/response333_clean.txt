Death's dark veil doth fall,
A somber sight to see.
The end of life's sweet call,
A time for me to be free.

In the land of shadows deep,
I'll find my final sleep.
Where dreams of life are sealed,
And all my cares are swept.

Death's gentle touch doth claim,
The lives that earth does hold.
But in death's peaceful frame,
I'll find a soul to unfold.

In death's embrace I'll find,
A love that knows no end.
For though it takes me home,
My spirit will transcend
