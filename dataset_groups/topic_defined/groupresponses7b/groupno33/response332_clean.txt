Death's dark wing doth spread,
A chilling sight to see.
The end of life's sweet bread,
A time for me to be free.

In the land of eternal sleep,
I'll find my final rest.
Where dreams of life are sealed,
And all my cares are best.

Death's gentle hand doth claim,
The lives that earth does hold.
But in death's peaceful frame,
I'll find a soul to unfold.

In death's embrace I'll find,
A love that knows no end.
For though it takes me home,
My spirit will transcend
