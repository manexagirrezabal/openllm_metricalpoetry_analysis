Attention, a spark that ignites the soul,
A flame that flickers with each goal.
It helps us see the world in a new light,
And makes each moment worth the fight.

With attention, we can learn and grow,
And make the most of every moment we know.
So let us cherish this precious gift with heart and hand,
And give it the focus it deserves to understand our land
