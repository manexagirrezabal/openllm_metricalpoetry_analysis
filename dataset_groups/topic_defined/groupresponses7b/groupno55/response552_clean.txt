Attention, a treasure to behold,
A gift that's valuable, young and old.
It helps us see the world in a new light,
And makes each moment worth the fight.

With attention, we can learn and grow,
And make the most of every moment we know.
So let us cherish this precious grace,
And give it the focus it deserves with haste.
