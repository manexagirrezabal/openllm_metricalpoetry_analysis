Attention, a gift we often take for granted,
Until it's gone and we're left feeling neglected.
It's the glue that holds our relationships strong,
And helps us connect with those around us all day long.

With attention, we can show we care,
And make each moment special, beyond compare.
So let us cherish this gift with glee,
And give it the focus it deserves, you see
