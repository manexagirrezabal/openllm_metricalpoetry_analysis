In the bustling streets of life,
Where sounds and sights are all strife,
Attention is a precious thing,
A gift that helps us stay on track and cling.

In the quiet moments of peace,
When thoughts are clear and heart can cease,
Attention brings us to our core,
And helps us find our inner strength once more.

But in the stillness of the night,
When worldly cares take flight,
Attention is a treasure true,
A gift that shines with love anew
