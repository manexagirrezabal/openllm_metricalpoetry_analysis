The crack of the bat, the smell of fresh cut grass
A home run soars through the sky, a thrilling chase
The crowd cheers on their team, as the game unfolds
Baseball is a game of skill and endless stories told
From the dugout to the field, the action never ceases
With every pitch, a new tale begins to seize
The excitement builds with each swing and miss
In baseball, magic happens with each blink of an eye.
