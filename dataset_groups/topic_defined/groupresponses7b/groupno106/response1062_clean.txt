The sun sets on the field, the game at its height
Players give it their all, in the heat of the fight
From home runs to diving catches, the action unfolds
Baseball's beauty on display, as the crowd grows bold
With every pitch, a new chapter unfolds
The excitement never fades, as legends are told
In baseball, greatness is made with each swing and roll.
