The ball flies through the air, a perfect flight
A runner races around the bases, a thrilling sight
From opening day to the final game
Baseball's magic never fades away
With every pitch, a new story unfolds
The excitement builds with each swing and score
In baseball, legends are made with each roll of the dice.
