Attention, oh attention, so fleeting and bright
Like a firefly in the night, it flickers out of sight
But when it's here, it's pure and true
A treasure to behold, and a gift anew

In a world that's busy and loud
Attention is hard to find, but oh so proud
It listens to our deepest desires
And helps us rise above our greatest fires

Like a gentle breeze on a summer's day
Attention can ease our worries away
It brings us peace and solace too
A refuge from the world anew

So cherish attention, hold it tight
For in its embrace, all is bright and right
And when it's gone, we'll miss its light
And the darkness will take flight.
