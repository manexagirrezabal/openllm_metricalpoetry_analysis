Stanza 1:
Aisles upon aisles of wonder,
Shelves stocked high and full of plunder,
Fresh produce and canned delight,
All under one roof, shining bright.

Stanza 2:
From eggs to milk and bread to butter,
Everything you need, right in the matter,
Canned goods and snacks galore,
A shopper's paradise, that's for sure.

Stanza 3:
Fresh meat and seafood too,
All neatly stacked and ready to view,
Bakery goods and prepared meals,
For a quick and easy home-cooked feel.

Stanza 4:
Carts and cashiers, customers too,
All hustling and bustling anew,
A supermarket's world within,
Where shopping is always fun to win.
