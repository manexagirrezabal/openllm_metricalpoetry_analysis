The year unfolds like a precious gem,
A treasure trove of memories to come.
With every passing day, it glows more bright,
A time for growth, a time for delight.

In winter's chill, the world slows down,
A time for rest, a time to drown.
The snowflakes dance, the fireplace roars,
As warmth and love are what we adore.

Spring's awakening brings new light,
A season of rebirth, a time so right.
The flowers bloom, the birds take flight,
As nature's beauty takes to the sky tonight.

Summer's heat brings long days of fun,
A time for adventures, just begun.
The laughter rings, the sun shines bright,
As friends and family bask in delight
