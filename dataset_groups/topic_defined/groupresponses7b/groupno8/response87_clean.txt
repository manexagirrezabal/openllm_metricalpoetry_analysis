Love is a flame that burns so bright,
A feeling that takes flight.
With every beat of its sweet embrace,
We know we are in the right place.

Love is a gift from above,
A treasure to cherish and love.
It brings us joy and sets us free,
A feeling that's truly divine to see.

With love, our hearts take flight,
We soar on wings of delight.
In its embrace, we find our home,
Where we belong, forever known.

Love is a force that moves the earth,
A power that gives us new birth.
It's the joy that we feel deep inside,
And makes our heart take flight.
