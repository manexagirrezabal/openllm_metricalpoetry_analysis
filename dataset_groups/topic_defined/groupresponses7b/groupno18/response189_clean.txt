In the mountains, peaks so high and steep,
Where eagles soar and rivers deep.
The air is crisp, the wind does howl and keep,
And nature's grandeur in the mountains does creep.

In the forest, trees so tall and strong,
Where creatures roam and secrets belong.
The wind does whisper, the leaves do dance and long,
And nature's beauty in the forest takes its stance
